THE SPONSOR UNDERTAKES NO OBLIGATION TO RELEASE THE RESULT OF ANY\\nREVISIONS TO THESE FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS THAT MAY BE MADE TO REFLECT ANY\\nFUTURE EVENTS OR CIRCUMSTANCES.\\nRISKS RELATED TO ASSISTED LIVING AND MEMORY CARE FACILITIES\\nRisks Specific to the Operation of an Assisted Living and Memory Care Facility. The Facilities are operated as\\nassisted living and memory care centers. These types of facilities are government regulated and licensed age-restricted rental\\ncommunities which provide assistance with the activities of daily living such as bathing, grooming, dressing and assistance\\nwith medication. As part of the senior housing and care industry, assisted living and memory care centers are subject to\\nsignificant regulation as well as established industry standards, customs, and practices. Changes in the laws or\\nreinterpretations of existing laws or industry standards can have a significant effect on methods of doing business and costs\\nof doing business. The Master Tenants, the Property Manager and the Facilities will be subject to varying degrees of\\nregulation and licensing by health or social service agencies and other federal and state regulatory authorities.\\nIn addition, the Gold Choice Palm Coast Facility participates in Medicaid, which is a significant source of income for\\nthat Facility. If such participation increases in the future, changes in federal and/or state Medicaid reimbursement rates may\\naffect the performance of the Gold Choice Palm Coast Facility. Medicaid is a politically sensitive program that may be\\nsubject to future cuts at the federal or state level. It is impossible to predict future cuts in Medicaid reimbursement rates or\\nparameters, and any such future cuts are not reflected in the Financial Projections and could adversely impact rental revenue\\nfrom the Gold Choice Palm Coast Facility and the value of the investments of Investors.\\nThe Facilities must at all times comply with applicable laws and standards; however, there can be no assurance that an\\nadministrative or judicial interpretation of existing laws, regulations or standards will not have a material adverse effect on\\nthe operation of the Facilities or the financial condition of the Trust. Noncompliance with applicable regulations or other\\nliability in connection with the operations of the Facilities may be due to a number of factors, including uncertainties in the\\nmeaning and scope of applicable regulations or in the appropriate standard of care, inadequate training or supervision of\\nonsite personnel, employee mistakes or inattention and the failure to become aware of newly adopted or changed regulations\\nor standards.\\nThe Trust will be dependent upon the Master Tenants to receive and maintain their licenses. If either of the Master\\nTenants does not maintain its licenses, the Trust will need to locate an alternative licensed facility administrator. Unless an\\nalternative licensed facility administrator can be located, the Trust will not be able to operate the Properties. Furthermore, if\\nfor any reason in the future, a license held by the Master Tenants were to be revoked, or the Master Tenants were to no longer\\nbe able to operate the Properties, then the Trust would need to find replacement facility administrators with the requisite\\nlicensing. The Trust would not be able to separately operate the Properties without experienced and licensed facility\\nadministrators.\\nFurther, the Trust’s success will be highly dependent upon the Master Tenants’ and the Property Manager’s abilities to\\nsatisfy the applicable regulations and requirements and to procure and maintain required licenses on a cost-effective basis.\\nOperations could also be adversely affected by, among other things, regulatory developments such as mandatory increases\\nin the scope and the quality of care to be afforded residents and revisions in licensing and certification standards. The Trust\\nhas not anticipated in the Financial Projections any amounts for compliance with new legal requirements. Should any\\nunforeseen legal and regulatory compliance expenses arise, they may adversely affect the Master Tenants’ ability to pay\\nRent to the Trust, which in turn may adversely affect the Trust’s cash available for distribution to Investors and the value of\\ntheir investment.\",\"textTemplate\":\"\",\"metadataSeparator\":\"\\n\",\"type\":\"DOCUMENT\",\"hash\":\"pwAnFys03VjMCuOUy1EXipbOWtKXpQDhmwJ8kbCMtDI=\"}","__type__":"DOCUMENT"},"./data/PPM - 1031CF Portfolio 6 DST.pdf_24":{"__data__":"{\"id_\":\"./data/PPM - 1031CF Portfolio 6 DST.pdf_24\",\"metadata\":{\"page_number\":24,\"total_pages\":244,\"file_path\":\"C:\\\\Users\\\\Pomelo\\\\Desktop\\\\Programing\\\\cima-prototype\\\\cima-prototype-js\\\\data\\\\PPM - 1031CF Portfolio 6 DST.pdf\",\"file_name\":\"PPM - 1031CF Portfolio 6 DST.pdf\",\"private\":\"false\"},\"excludedEmbedMetadataKeys\":[],\"excludedLlmMetadataKeys\":[],\"relationships\":{},\"text\":\"{01479718.1 } 18\\nProviding Assisted Living and Memory Care Requires Specialized Services and Staffing and Can be Expensive.\\nThe Properties offer assisted living and memory care. Residents suffering from conditions such as Alzheimer’s require\\nadditional care and supervision and may, at times, be disruptive to the other residents in the community. A higher level of\\nstaffing is required to manage a memory unit and thus, operating margins at the Properties may suffer in periods of lower\\noccupancy. This could, in turn, affect the Master Tenants’ ability to pay the Rent.\\nResident Rate of Occupancy. As of the closing date, the physical occupancy rate of the Facilities was approximately\\n93.0% at the Gold Choice Palm Coast Facility and 79.2% at the Canopy at Harper Lake Facility based on the functional\\nmaximum number of beds. The Financial Projections assume stabilized physical occupancy of both the Gold Choice Palm\\nCoast Facility and the Canopy at Harper Lake Facility at 92% (based on the functional maximum number of beds) during\\nthe Trust’s ownership and no concessions, but there can be no assurance that the Facilities will achieve or maintain such\\nrates as contemplated in the assumptions for such Financial Projections. If there is a substantial decrease in residents admitted\\nto the Facilities or if current residents cease to continue their residency at the Facilities, the operating results of the Facilities\\ncould be substantially and adversely affected by the loss of revenue. There can be no assurance that the Properties will be\\nsubstantially occupied at the projected resident fees. There can be no assurance that the Property Manager will be able to fill\\navailable Units and beds in the Facilities or maintain the current levels of occupancy. In addition, it may be necessary to\\nmake concessions in terms of resident fees and provide other incentives to attract new residents or to keep existing residents.\\nIf these expenditures and concessions continue to be necessary, or in fact were to increase, the financial performance of the\\nFacilities would be adversely affected. In addition, residents may be unable to make their fee payments. Defaults by a\\nsignificant number of residents could, depending on the extent of the effect on the occupancy rate of the Facilities and the\\nability to successfully find substitute residents, have a material adverse effect on the financial performance of the Facilities,\\nwhich would materially adversely affect the Master Tenants’ ability to pay the Rent to the Trust, and therefore, the Trust’s\\nability to pay returns to Investors.\\nConcessions. In order to entice potential residents to sign a Rental Agreement or to entice existing residents to remain\\nat the Facilities, management may need to employ the use of concessions or incentives due to competition from nearby\\nproperties for new and existing residents, some of which properties may be owned or operated by the Sponsor or its principals\\nor their Affiliates in the future. This would directly affect cash flow to Investors.\\nResident Turnover Rates are High and Difficult to Predict. The advanced age of residents at assisted living and\\nmemory care facilities such as the Properties makes resident turnover rates high and difficult to predict. To maintain a\\nstabilized occupancy level, the Master Tenants must be constantly leasing to prospective Residents. In addition, state\\nregulations governing some assisted living and memory care facilities require written rental agreements with each resident,\\nand, in some cases, state regulations require that each resident have the right to terminate the rental agreement for any reason\\non reasonable notice or upon the death of the resident. Accordingly, the Master Tenants may not be permitted to contract\\nwith Residents to stay for longer periods of time, and unlike typical apartment leasing arrangements with terms of one year\\nor longer, the Rental Agreements to be entered into by the Master Tenants are expected to be on month-to-month terms. If a\\nlarge number of Residents elected to terminate their Rental Agreement at or around the same time, and if the units remain\\nunoccupied, then the revenues and earnings derived from the Properties would be adversely affected. There is no assurance\\nthat the Master Tenants will be able to maintain occupancy rates sufficient to operate the Properties profitably.\\nOperating Senior Housing Facilities Entails Substantial Risk of Liability. Senior housing operators and their staffs\\nare responsible for much of the daily care of residents. This will include assistance in bathing, eating, dressing and the\\nadministration of medications. Should a Resident become injured, ill or die, the Master Tenants may be subject to liability.\\nThe terms of the Master Leases require the Master Tenants to pay directly or reimburse the costs of premiums for maintaining\\nliability insurance to cover such exposure, but no assurance can be given that any such insurance will cover all these or other\\nliabilities or losses.\\nIt May be Difficult to Attract and Retain Skilled Employees to Operate the Properties. The majority of the work\\nin the senior care industry is closely tied to resident care. This work is demanding and relatively low paying. Consequently,\\nturnover in the staff level of the senior care industry is very high. The Property Manager faces substantial competition with\\nrespect to the hiring and retention of qualified personnel and is dependent upon the existing available labor pool in the\\nmarkets in which the Facilities are located. Therefore, adequate human resources and training personnel, competitive pay\\nand benefits, and constant staff recruiting must be maintained to ensure adequate and capable staffing levels. The Trust has\\nassumed certain increases in labor costs in creating the Financial Projections; however, there can be no assurance that labor\\ncosts will not increase at a faster than projected rate, or that the Property Manager will be able to attract the necessary\\npersonnel at a reasonable cost. To the extent the Property Manager’s costs exceed those projected, the Master Tenants’ ability\",\"textTemplate\":\"\",\"metadataSeparator\":\"\\n\",\"type\":\"DOCUMENT\",\"hash\":\"XztTY1lYd+ARprDjI4ZDjo4eBLcWJ5YCjoXW/E8EO+Y=\"}","__type__":"DOCUMENT"},"./data/PPM - 1031CF Portfolio 6 DST.pdf_25":{"__data__":"{\"id_\":\"./data/PPM - 1031CF Portfolio 6 DST.pdf_25\",\"metadata\":{\"page_number\":25,\"total_pages\":244,\"file_path\":\"C:\\\\Users\\\\Pomelo\\\\Desktop\\\\Programing\\\\cima-prototype\\\\cima-prototype-js\\\\data\\\\PPM - 1031CF Portfolio 6 DST.pdf\",\"file_name\":\"PPM - 1031CF Portfolio 6 DST.pdf\",\"private\":\"false\"},\"excludedEmbedMetadataKeys\":[],\"excludedLlmMetadataKeys\":[],\"relationships\":{},\"text\":\"{01479718.1 } 19\\nto pay Rent to the Trust may be adversely affected. No assurance can be given that the Master Tenants and/or Property\\nManager will be able to attract and retain senior and staff-level employees in sufficient numbers to operate the Properties\\nprofitably.\\nThe Assisted Living and Memory Care Industry is Highly Regulated at the Federal, State and Local Levels.\\nGovernment regulations regarding assisted living and memory care facilities may cover a broad range of issues, including\\nbut not limited to minimum staffing requirements, staff education, training and record keeping, physical plant specifications,\\nfood and housekeeping services, and fire safety and emergency evacuation guidelines. These requirements are not standard\\nacross the country and can be changed at any time, making compliance with local regulations extremely cumbersome.\\nSignificant resources must be committed to maintaining compliance with all applicable laws and regulations. No assurances\\ncan be given that the Master Tenants will be able to maintain the necessary licenses to provide assisted living and memory\\ncare or other services, or to maintain legal compliance at the Properties.\\nThe Properties are expected to be subject to inspection by one or more federal, state or local agencies. Inspections may\\noccur on a scheduled or unscheduled basis, and special inspections may result from complaints filed by Residents, Residents’\\nfamilies, employees, or competitors. From time to time in the ordinary course of business, the Properties may be the subject\\nof deficiency reports, which would require appropriate corrective action. A reviewing agency may have authority to take\\naction against a licensed facility over and above corrective action. Such actions could include imposition of fines, suspension\\nor revocation of a license, civil or criminal penalties or other sanctions. Such actions could materially and adversely affect\\nthe Properties’ revenue and income and therefore, the Master Tenants’ ability to pay the Rent.\\nCompliance with Environmental Regulations May be Time-Consuming and Expensive. The management of\\ninfectious medical waste, including handling, storage, transportation, treatment and disposal, is subject to regulation under\\nvarious laws, including federal and state environmental laws. These environmental laws set forth the management\\nrequirements, as well as permit, record-keeping, notice and reporting obligations. To the extent the Properties generate\\ninfectious medical waste, the Properties will be required to comply with all applicable regulations, which would increase\\ncompliance and operating expenses at the Properties.\\nCompetition for Residents. Providers of assisted living and memory care housing and services compete for residents\\nprimarily on the basis of quality of care, price, reputation, physical appearance of the communities, services offered, family\\nand physician preferences and location. While the Trust believes that the Facilities will be successful in attracting residents,\\nthere can be no assurance that the Property Manager will successfully market it or maintain its occupancy. The Facilities’\\npotential competitors in this industry include national, regional and local operators of assisted living communities, long-term\\ncare residences, rehabilitation hospitals, extended care centers and skilled nursing facilities, retirement communities,\\nindependent living communities and home healthcare providers. A number of assisted living and memory care centers of\\nsimilar size and amenities are located within a ten-mile radius of each of the Facilities and in the Facilities’ respective\\nsubmarkets. The Appraisals indicated there are seven (7) competitive healthcare facilities within the Gold Choice Palm Coast\\nFacility’s target market and are three (3) competitive healthcare facilities currently within the Canopy at Harper Lake\\nFacility’s target market, which may otherwise attract residents that would otherwise go to the Facilities. Competing properties\\nmay reduce demand for the Facilities, increase vacancy rates, decrease resident rates and impact the value of the Properties\\nthemselves. It is possible that residents of the Properties will move to an existing or new assisted living and memory care\\ncenter in the surrounding area, which could adversely affect the financial performance of the Facilities. Competition from\\nnearby assisted living and memory care centers could make it more difficult to attract new residents, maintain resident rates\\nat their current levels and ultimately sell the Properties on a profitable basis. Further, the availability of possible sites for\\nfuture construction may affect vacancy and resident rates if additional competitive properties are developed in the future.\\nThere is no assurance that the Master Tenants will maintain the current position of the Facilities or better compete in the\\nPalm Coast or Lake City, Florida market.\\nMedical Waste Liability. The Trust anticipates that the Facilities will generate potentially infectious waste due to the\\nillness or physical condition of some of the residents, including used bandages, swabs and other medical waste products and\\nincontinence products of those residents diagnosed with infectious diseases. The management of potentially infectious\\nmedical waste, including handling, storage, transportation, treatment and disposal is subject to regulation under federal and\\nstate laws. These laws and regulations set forth requirements for managing medical waste, as well as permit, record keeping,\\nnotice and reporting obligations. The Master Tenants are required to operate the Facilities, through the Property Manager, in\\na manner that complies with such regulations. However, these regulations are highly complex and are amended from time to\\ntime, so there can be no assurance that the Master Tenants will be successful in continued compliance. Any finding that the\\nFacilities is not in compliance with these laws and regulations could adversely affect the Facilities’ business operations and\",\"textTemplate\":\"\",\"metadataSeparator\":\"\\n\",\"type\":\"DOCUMENT\",\"hash\":\"fc0C5o10AwP9sSAF1HeyUU5/9WZKGR2RLstyTGclRko=\"}","__type__":"DOCUMENT"},"./data/PPM - 1031CF Portfolio 6 DST.pdf_26":{"__data__":"{\"id_\":\"./data/PPM - 1031CF Portfolio 6 DST.pdf_26\",\"metadata\":{\"page_number\":26,\"total_pages\":244,\"file_path\":\"C:\\\\Users\\\\Pomelo\\\\Desktop\\\\Programing\\\\cima-prototype\\\\cima-prototype-js\\\\data\\\\PPM - 1031CF Portfolio 6 DST.pdf\",\"file_name\":\"PPM - 1031CF Portfolio 6 DST.pdf\",\"private\":\"false\"},\"excludedEmbedMetadataKeys\":[],\"excludedLlmMetadataKeys\":[],\"relationships\":{},\"text\":\"{01479718.1 } 20\\nfinancial condition, which could adversely affect the Master Tenants’ ability to pay Rent, and, ultimately, the Trust’s ability\\nto make distributions to Investors.\\nThe Trust May Be Subject to Healthcare Reimbursement Law Liability. Federal laws governing healthcare\\nreimbursement programs provide for civil monetary penalties in the event of fraud or abuse with respect to billing submitted\\nto such reimbursement programs. In the event of fraud or abuse by any management company that the Trust may engage,\\nsuch civil monetary penalties may be levied against the Properties and the Trust.\\nOther Litigation Risks and Insurance Costs for Healthcare Operations. In several well-publicized instances, private\\nlitigation by residents of senior living communities for negligence or alleged abuses has resulted in large damage awards\\nagainst some operating companies in the senior living industry. The effect of this litigation and potential litigation has been\\nto dramatically increase the costs of monitoring and reporting quality of care compliance incurred by companies operating\\nfacilities similar to the Facilities. Workers’ compensation and employee health insurance costs have also increased in recent\\nyears. Medical liability insurance reform has become a topic of political debate and some states have enacted legislation to\\nlimit future liability awards. However, if such reforms are not generally adopted, insurance costs may continue to increase.\\nIf insurance costs for the Facilities increase faster than projected it will likely adversely affect the operating cash flow of the\\nMaster Tenants, and therefore the Trust and its ability to pay distributions to Investors.\\nCyber Attack and Risk of Economic Harm. If the Facilities or the Property Manager or their computer systems are\\nthe targets of a cyberattack, such attack could result in the loss of information, or the release of confidential information, of\\nthe Facilities, residents of the Facilities, or the Property Manager that could result in losses, costs and expenses to the\\nFacilities and their operations, and therefore materially and adversely affect the investment of Investors.\\nThe Gold Choice Palm Coast Property Has a Total of 50-Units and the Canopy at Harper Lake Property Has a\\nTotal of 64-Units and There May Not Be a Market in the Future to Find Residents to Fill each Property. While the\\nmarket currently appears to be strong enough to support properties of this size it might not remain strong in the future and\\nbeds could become empty due to a shortage of prospective residents.\\nREAL ESTATE RISKS\\nGeneral Risk of Investment in the Properties. The economic success of the Interests will depend upon the results of\\noperations of the Facilities. The results of the operation are subject to those risks typically associated with investments in\\nreal estate in addition to the risks specific to senior care facilities. Fluctuations in vacancy rates, residency rates and operating\\nexpenses (including utilities, taxes and insurance) can adversely affect operating results or render the sale or other disposition\\nof the Properties difficult or unattractive. No assurance can be given that certain assumptions as to the future levels of\\noccupancy of the Facilities, future residency rates, future cost of capital improvements or future costs of operating the\\nFacilities will be accurate since such matters will depend on events and factors beyond the control of the Master Tenants,\\nthe Property Manager, the Trust, the Signatory Trustee and the Investors. Such factors include continued validity and\\nenforceability of the resident contracts, vacancy rates for properties similar to the Facilities, financial resources of residents,\\nresidency rates of nearby competing facilities, adverse changes in local population trends, market conditions, neighborhood\\nvalues, local economic and social conditions, supply and demand for properties similar to the Facilities and the Properties,\\ncompetition from similar properties, some of which may be owned or operated by the Sponsor, or their principals or\\nAffiliates, interest rates and real estate tax rates, governmental rules, regulations and fiscal policies, the enactment of\\nunfavorable real estate, environmental, zoning or hazardous materials laws, uninsured losses, effects of inflation and other\\nrisks.\\nCasualty to or Condemnation of the Properties. Damage to the Properties or any portion thereof due to fire or other\\ncasualty or condemnation could have a material and adverse effect on the Properties, including but not limited to loss of\\nrevenue, potential claims by Residents, and costs to restore the Properties in the event insurance proceeds are unavailable.\\nLimited Capital of the Master Tenants. The capitalization of the Master Tenants will be supported solely by: (i) the\\ninitial reallocation and contribution to the Master Tenants of approximately $100,000 of acquisition fee (which is anticipated\\nto be distributed to the Sponsor over the first 6 months of the hold period), and (ii) the $600,000 Demand Note. The Sponsor\\nanticipates funding the Demand Note with proceeds from the Offering that, if not needed for Master Tenants working capital,\\nwill become additional acquisition fee compensation to the Sponsor. Following its contribution to the Master Tenants of the\\nacquisition fee reallocated, the Sponsor is under no obligation to contribute capital to the Master Tenants other than the\\namount of the Demand Note.

However, no assurance\\ncan be given that the reallocation of the acquisition fee to the Master Tenants and the $600,000 Demand Note will be\\nsufficient to enable the Master Tenants to pay the Rent or to fund its obligations under the Master Leases. If either of the\\nMaster Tenants are unable to pay the Rent or satisfy its obligations under the Master Leases, the applicable Master Tenant\\nwould be in default on the applicable Master Lease and the Trust would likely terminate the applicable Master Lease. In\\nsuch event, the Trust may not be able to master lease the Property on terms similar to the applicable Master Lease. If the\\nTrust were unable to enter into a new master lease for the Property, the returns to Investors would likely be materially\\nadversely affected. In addition, if the Trust were unable to enter into a new master lease, it would likely become necessary\\nfor the Trust to spring into a Springing LLC in order to engage in leasing activities, which would be likely to have adverse\\ntax consequences to Investors. Absent a bankruptcy by the Master Tenants, the Signatory Trustee would not be empowered\\nto execute such a replacement Master Lease and would be required to spring into a Springing LLC. Upon a termination of\\na Master Lease, whether as a result of a bankruptcy of the applicable Master Tenant, termination in connection with a\\ndisposition, or other termination, any outstanding operating costs of the applicable Property that were the obligation of the\\napplicable Master Tenant under its Master Lease may become the obligations of the Trust. See “RISK FACTORS – Risks\\nRelating to the Trust Structure – Limited Powers of Trustees; Risk of Termination of Trust.”\\nActs of Terrorism. We do not anticipate procuring insurance coverage for terrorism. In the event the Properties are\\ndamaged by a terrorist attack, Investors could lose some or all of their investment.\\nUncertain Economic Conditions. Economic conditions have become increasingly uncertain over recent months, with\\nhigh inflation, rising interest rates and increasingly negative market conditions. A continuing downturn in, or weakening of,\\nthe economy and/or the real estate industry could have an adverse impact on the economic performance of the Properties,\\nthe income of the Trust, and the ultimate sales or other disposition price that can be obtained for the Properties by the Trust.\\nTo the extent Residents of the Properties experience a serious economic setback, including as a result of inflation, they might\\nnot be able to pay rent at the current rate or at all, which could adversely impact the ability of the Master Tenants to pay Rent\\nunder the Master Leases, resulting in a loss of income to the Trust. In addition, continued inflation at a historic pace may\\nincrease the costs of operation of the Properties at faster than projected rates, resulting in decreased cash flow to the Master\\nTenants which could adversely impact their ability to pay Rent.\\nEffects of the COVID-19 Pandemic and other pandemics, local epidemics or other infectious disease. Pandemics,\\nsuch as the COVID-19 pandemic, and outbreaks of local epidemics and other infectious disease may adversely impact the\\nProperties and the operations of the Facilities, including their financial condition and cash flows. The Trust’s and Master\\nTenants’ business activities and economic performance could also be negatively impacted by federal, state, or local\\ngovernment laws and regulations in response to a pandemic or local outbreak, including restrictions on travel, quarantines,\\nand additional regulation of senior living facilities. The Master Tenants depend on rental revenues and other property income\\nfrom the Residents of the Facilities for substantially all of their revenues in order to pay Rent under the Master Leases. An\\noutbreak of COVID-19, a severe cold and flu season or an outbreak of another contagious disease in the state of Florida,\\nwhere the Properties are located, could result in significant adverse consequences including a regulatory ban on admissions,\\ndecreased occupancy, failures of the Master Tenants to make lease payments, loss of reputation and lawsuits. Additionally,\\na pandemic and related containment measures would interfere with the ability of our associates, suppliers, and other business\\npartners and those of the Property Manager to carry out their assigned tasks or supply materials, services, or funding at\\nordinary levels of performance relative to the conduct of our business. The effects of a pandemic like COVID-19 may also\\nresult in increased personnel costs for the operation of senior care facilities like the COVID-19 pandemic did. The degree\\nto which a further COVID-19 outbreak or another infectious disease may impact the results of operations and financial\\ncondition of the Properties is unknown at this time and will depend on future developments, including further geographic\\nspread of COVID-19, the severity and the duration of the pandemic and further actions that may be taken by governmental\\nauthorities, businesses or individuals on their own initiatives in response to the pandemic. Any variants to the COVID-19\\nvirus and the corresponding effects to those infected cannot be predicted.\\nThe COVID-19 pandemic and ensuing challenges with increasing costs in the senior housing industry materially and\\nadversely affected the performance and financial condition of certain of the Sponsor’s prior DST programs that purchased\\nsenior care programs prior to the onset of the pandemic. See “MANAGEMENT – Prior Adverse Developments.” While\\nthe Sponsor believes it has accounted for the effects of the pandemic and increased operational costs in its acquisition of the\\nProperties and in the Financial Projections of the Properties performance, the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic and other\\npandemics or infectious diseases are inherently unpredictable and may materially and adversely affect the Properties and\\ntheir performance, including their ability to generate cash flow as projected, the Master Tenants’ ability to pay the Rent, and\\nthe Trust’s ability to pay distributions to Investors.\",\"textTemplate\":\"\",\"metadataSeparator\":\"\\n\",\"type\":\"DOCUMENT\",\"hash\":\"UTgNJsBDQ+wZRbnLTa67TXryAIoNeOzENkx4S4a+re4=\"}","__type__":"DOCUMENT"},"./data/PPM - 1031CF Portfolio 6 DST.pdf_28":{"__data__":"{\"id_\":\"./data/PPM - 1031CF Portfolio 6 DST.pdf_28\",\"metadata\":{\"page_number\":28,\"total_pages\":244,\"file_path\":\"C:\\\\Users\\\\Pomelo\\\\Desktop\\\\Programing\\\\cima-prototype\\\\cima-prototype-js\\\\data\\\\PPM - 1031CF Portfolio 6 DST.pdf\",\"file_name\":\"PPM - 1031CF Portfolio 6 DST.pdf\",\"private\":\"false\"},\"excludedEmbedMetadataKeys\":[],\"excludedLlmMetadataKeys\":[],\"relationships\":{},\"text\":\"{01479718.1 } 22\\nCompliance with Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990. If the Properties are not in compliance with the Americans\\nwith Disabilities Act of 1990, as amended (the “ADA”), the Master Tenants or Trust may be required to pay for\\nimprovements to effect compliance with the ADA. Under the ADA, public accommodations must meet certain federal\\nrequirements related to access and use by disabled persons. The ADA requirements could require removal of access barriers\\nat significant cost, and could result in the imposition of fines by the federal government or an award of damages to private\\nlitigants. State and federal laws in this area are constantly evolving, and could evolve to place a greater cost or burden on the\\nTrust as the owner of the Properties. Any future construction, renovations or improvements to the Properties impacting\\naccessibility may also be required to comply with Washington state regulations. If the Trust or Master Tenants are required\\nto make improvements to the Properties in order to comply with ADA, it could adversely impact the funds available to the\\nTrust, and the Investors’ return.\\nIn connection with the ADA, the scope of the PCAs for the Properties was limited and did not constitute full ADA\\nCompliance Surveys. During the site visits to the Properties, visual observations were made to identify barriers to general\\naccessibility to areas of public accommodations including the common area restrooms and parking. The Property Assessor\\nperformed a baseline ADA Visual Accessibility Survey which indicates that the Properties appear to be generally conforming\\nto ADA requirements. The scope of the PCAs did not cover the residential units at the Properties. These observations were\\nlimited, and a full ADA Compliance Survey may reveal additional aspects of the Properties that are not in compliance with\\nthe ADA. If material non-compliance exists and the Trust or Master Tenants are required to make material improvements to\\nthe Properties in order to comply with ADA, such improvements could materially adversely impact the funds available to\\nthe Trust and could potentially trigger the conversion of the Trust into Springing LLCs to the extent extensive capital\\nrenovations become necessary to comply. See “RISK FACTORS – Tax Risks – If the Trust is Converted into a Springing\\nLLC, the Investors’ Ownership Interests in the Springing LLC will not Qualify for Future Tax-Deferred Exchange Treatment\\nunder Code Section 1031.”\\nEnvironmental Liability. Federal, state and local laws may impose liability on a property owner for releases, or the\\notherwise-improper presence on the property, of hazardous substances without regard to fault or knowledge of the presence\\nof such substances. A property owner may be held liable for environmental releases of such substances that occurred before\\nit acquired title and that are not discovered until after it sells the property. If any hazardous substances are found at any time\\non the Properties, the Trust may be held liable for all cleanup costs, fines, penalties and other costs regardless of whether it\\nowned the Properties when the releases occurred or the hazardous substances were discovered. Under one such law, the\\nComprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act (“CERCLA”), a purchaser of property may\\nqualify for certain defenses to, and exemptions from, liability under CERCLA by obtaining a new or updated Environmental\\nSite Assessment that qualifies as an “All Appropriate Inquiry” under CERCLA, as long as such Assessment was conducted,\\nor updated, within 180 days of the purchase of the property. A Phase I Environmental Site Assessment performed in\\ncompliance with ASTM E 1527-05 qualifies as an “All Appropriate Inquiry” under CERCLA. The Sponsor has obtained the\\nPhase 1 Environmental Site Assessment for the Properties.\\nA Phase I Environmental Site Assessment was performed for each the Gold Choice Palm Coast Property (the “Palm\\nCoast Phase 1 Assessment”) and the Canopy at Harper Lake Property (the “Harper Lake Phase I Assessment” and together\\nwith the Palm Coast Phase 1 Assessment, the “Phase I Assessments”) by AEI Consultants (“Environmental Assessor”). Both\\nthe Palm Coast Phase 1 Assessment and the Harper Lake Phase I Assessment are dated June 6, 2023. Copies of the Phase I\\nAssessments will be provided upon request electronically. The Phase I Assessments are for informational purposes only. The\\nTrust will not obtain from the preparer of the Phase I Assessments, a reliance letter which would entitle the Trust, among\\nothers, to rely on the Phase I Assessments and to enforce any claims against the preparers of the assessment if they failed to\\nidentify any particular deficiency. Whether a reliance letter is obtained or not, there is no guaranty Investors would be entitled\\nto rely on the PCAs. In addition, there can be no assurance that the preparer of the PCAs would be held liable for any losses\\nin connection with deficiencies in the Properties that were not identified in the PCAs. Furthermore, there can be no assurance\\nthat financial wherewithal of such preparers would be sufficient to cover any loss that may arise, should they be held liable.\\nThe Palm Coast Phase 1 Assessment reported one environmental consideration and the Harper Lake Phase I Assessment\\ndid not reveal any evidence of recognizable environmental conditions. Based on the conclusions of the Phase I Assessments,\\nthe Environmental Assessor recommended no further investigation of the Properties. The Phase I Assessments, however, do\\nnot involve any invasive testing and are limited to a physical walk through or inspection of the Properties and a review of\\nthe related environmental and governmental records. Consequently, there are no assurances that any or all existing\\nenvironmental problems or conditions with the Properties would be exposed by the Phase I Assessments. It is possible that\\nan environmental claim may be raised in such a manner that the claim could become enforceable against the Trust.

If losses arise from hazardous substance contamination\\nthat cannot be recovered from a responsible party, the financial viability of the Properties may be substantially affected. In\\nan extreme case, the Properties may be rendered worthless, or the Trust may be obligated to pay cleanup and other costs in\\nexcess of the value of the Properties.\\nRisk of Mold Contamination. Mold contamination has been linked to a number of health problems, resulting in recent\\nlitigation in which the plaintiffs are seeking various remedies, including damages and the ability to terminate their leases.\\nSeveral insurance companies have reported an increase in mold-related claims, causing a growing concern in the real estate\\ncommunity that real estate owners might be subject to increasing lawsuits regarding mold contamination. Environmental\\nAssessor’s assessment of the Properties included limited visual and olfactory assessment for the presence of moisture\\nconditions. The Phase I Assessments note that the Environmental Assessor did not observe obvious visual or olfactory\\nindications of significant moisture conditions in readily accessible interior areas of the Properties conditions. However, the\\nPhase I Assessments should not be construed as a mold survey or inspection. Moisture conditions that could be conducive\\nto the growth of mold, if present, may or may not visually manifest itself. A comprehensive review of the Properties in\\nconnection with either moisture conditions or mold has not been performed, and no assurance can be given that either a\\nmoisture or mold condition does not exist or will not arise in the future. The Trust does not intend to obtain insurance for\\nloss related to moisture conditions or mold contamination.\\nEarthquake, Hurricane and Flood Exposure. The Sponsor makes no representation as to whether the Facilities are\\nlocated within a flood plain or a high-risk area for wind or seismic activity. Both Properties are located in Flood Zone XN,\\nan area of minimal flood hazard. The Palm Coast PCA indicated that Gold Choice Palm Coast Property is located in Seismic\\nZone 0 with a very low probability of damaging ground motion and the Harper Lake PCA indicate that the Canopy at Harper\\nLake Property is located in Seismic Zone 1, an area of low probability of damaging ground motion. Both of the Properties\\nare located in Wind Zone III, coastal areas that can occasionally experience damaging hurricanes, and are located in a state\\nthat is expected to experience greater hardships due to the effects of climate change. There can be no assurances that the\\nFacilities will not be damaged in the future by seismic, wind or flood activity and prospective Investors should consider these\\nrisks in their evaluation of the Facilities and the Properties, particularly since, although Properties will be covered for wind\\ndamage through property insurance, the Trust does not anticipate obtaining insurance against each of the above risks.\\nProperties Not a Diversified Investment. By the terms of the Trust Agreement, the Trust generally is not permitted to\\nacquire real property other than the Properties, or to acquire any other assets or make any other investments. Because an\\ninvestment in Interests represents an investment in one property, it is not a diversified investment. Accordingly, the poor\\nperformance of the Properties could adversely affect the profitability of the Interests.\\nDifficulty Making Material Modifications to the Facilities. In order to preserve its status as a fixed investment trust,\\nthe Trust is not permitted to make any modifications to the Facilities other than minor nonstructural modifications, and\\nrepairs in order to preserve the Properties or as required by law. As a result, the Trust may find it difficult to make any\\nmaterial modifications to the Facilities or to reposition the Facilities in the future, even if such modifications would be\\ndeemed appropriate for purposes of assisting in the marketing of the Facilities.\\nSpeculative Investment. No assurance can be given that the Investors will satisfy their investment objectives. No\\nassurance can be given that the Investors will realize a substantial return (if any) on their investment or that they will not\\nlose their entire investment in the Properties. For this reason, prospective Investors should carefully read this Memorandum.\\nAll such persons or entities should consult with their attorney and business and tax advisors prior to making an investment.\\nDetermination of Purchase Price/Valuation. The Trust purchased the Properties from the Sellers, which are\\nunaffiliated third parties, for an aggregate purchase price of $21,150,000, and incurred closing costs, preferred equity\\ncarrying costs, an acquisition fee to the Sponsor and related transaction and offering costs (see “SUMMARY OF THE\\nOFFERING – Properties – Acquisition”). However, the purchase price for the Interests is determined unilaterally by the\\nTrust and is not based on an arm’s-length negotiation. The total purchase price for the Interests is significantly higher than\\nthe Trust’s aggregate purchase price for the Properties. Therefore, Investors should not expect that the price paid for their\\ninvestment is reflective of the fair market value of the Properties on a stand-alone basis. Investors are, however, acquiring\\ntheir Interests based on the existence of the Master Leases and the management expertise provided by Affiliates of the\",\"textTemplate\":\"\",\"metadataSeparator\":\"\\n\",\"type\":\"DOCUMENT\",\"hash\":\"59U2UaqQy1hHGEuFTg8Cvq4celaowekpXkRgREBh4YQ=\"}","__type__":"DOCUMENT"},"./data/PPM - 1031CF Portfolio 6 DST.pdf_30":{"__data__":"{\"id_\":\"./data/PPM - 1031CF Portfolio 6 DST.pdf_30\",\"metadata\":{\"page_number\":30,\"total_pages\":244,\"file_path\":\"C:\\\\Users\\\\Pomelo\\\\Desktop\\\\Programing\\\\cima-prototype\\\\cima-prototype-js\\\\data\\\\PPM - 1031CF Portfolio 6 DST.pdf\",\"file_name\":\"PPM - 1031CF Portfolio 6 DST.pdf\",\"private\":\"false\"},\"excludedEmbedMetadataKeys\":[],\"excludedLlmMetadataKeys\":[],\"relationships\":{},\"text\":\"{01479718.1 } 24\\nSponsor. Nevertheless, there is no evidence that such additional rights support the difference between the total purchase price\\nfor the Properties, on the one hand, and the Maximum Offering Amount, on the other hand. Investors should also be aware\\nthat it may not be possible to sell or otherwise dispose of the Properties at a later date for a price equal to or greater than the\\npurchase price paid by the Investors for their Interests. In the event that the Properties must be sold or otherwise disposed of\\nfor less than the purchase price paid by the Investors for their Interests, the Investors’ financial goals will be adversely\\naffected.\\nClosing Costs. Closing costs and other fees payable in connection with the purchase of the Properties included, title\\ninsurance costs, escrow fees, recording costs, allocation of legal fees, and transfer taxes. The Trust will be partially\\nreimbursed for such costs and expenses from the Offering Proceeds. It is also possible that if the Signatory Trustee has\\noverestimated the costs, there will be additional fees, equal to the excess of such collected amount over the actual cost\\nincurred for the closing costs, remaining. Any excess funds will be returned to the Sponsor. In addition, any underestimation\\nof such fees and costs will be borne by the Sponsor.\\nNo Guaranteed Cash Flow. There can be no assurance that cash flow or profits will be generated by the Properties. If\\nthe Properties do not generate anticipated cash flow, the Master Tenants may not be able to pay the Rent to the Trust, in\\nwhich event the Investors would not receive their anticipated cash flow from the Interests. If the Rent is deferred, the Rent\\nis not paid for any reason, or the Rent paid is not the full amount due, there will be less or no cash flow for distributions to\\nthe Investors.\\nNo Audited Results of Operation; No Guaranteed Cash Flow. The Trust does not intend to obtain, and thus will not\\nprovide to prospective Investors, audited operating statements regarding the prior operations of the Properties. The Trust is\\nrelying on financial information provided by the Sellers, which the Sellers have represented to be accurate in the Contracts\\nof Purchase and Sale; however, the Sellers have not provided audited financial information for the Trust to rely on. It is\\npossible that information relied upon by the Trust with respect to the acquisition of the Properties may not be accurate, and\\nthe Trust does not make any warranties as to the accuracy or completeness of the information supplied. Potential Investors\\nshould make a careful examination of the Financial Projections attached as Exhibit D with the assistance of their financial\\nadvisors and are invited to conduct their own examination of financial data provided. If the Properties do not generate\\nsufficient cash flow, then the Master Tenants may be unable to pay the Rent and Investors’ returns may be materially and\\nadversely affected.\\nLimited Representations and Warranties of Sellers. The Trust has acquired the Properties “as is,” with only limited\\nrepresentations and warranties from the Sellers, including with respect to environmental matters, the existence of hazardous\\nmaterials, and matters affecting the condition, use and ownership of the Properties. As a result, if defects in the Properties,\\nRental Agreement disputes or other matters adversely affecting the Properties are discovered, the Trust may not be able to\\npursue a claim for any or all of its damages against the Sellers of the Properties. Additionally, the Master Tenants have\\nobtained certain limited representations and warranties and indemnities from the current facility operator and the Property\\nManager as to the operations and management of the Facilities prior to the Closing. These indemnities may not be sufficient\\nto make the Master Tenants whole in the event they become subject to any material pre-Closing operational or management\\nliability.\\nPhysical Condition of the Properties; No Representations to Investors. The Trust will not make any warranties or\\nrepresentations to the Investors regarding the condition of the Properties. The PCAs will be provided upon request\\nelectronically. The PCAs are for informational purposes only. The Trust will not obtain from the preparer of the PCAs, a\\nreliance letter which would entitle the Trust, among others, to rely on the PCAs and to enforce any claims against AEI\\nConsultants as the preparer of the PCAs if the Property Assessor failed to identify any particular Properties deficiency.\\nWhether a reliance letter is obtained or not, there is no guaranty Investors would be entitled to rely on the PCAs. In addition,\\nthere can be no assurance that the preparer of the PCAs would be held liable for any losses in connection with deficiencies\\nin the Properties that were not identified in the PCAs. Furthermore, there can be no assurance that financial wherewithal of\\nsuch preparers would be sufficient to cover any loss that may arise, should they be held liable.\\nThe PCAs state that the Properties appear to be in good overall condition, but the PCAs may not recognize necessary\\ncurrent repairs or repairs needed in the near future, and there can be no assurance that sufficient funds will be available for\\nall repairs that become necessary.

The Master Tenants, subject the terms of their respective Master\\nLeases, may have access to the Trust-Held Reserve for capital expenditures and other Property-specific costs and expenses.\\n“SUMMARY OF THE MASTER LEASE – Reserve Accounts.” To the extent that expenses of the Properties increase or\\nunanticipated expenses arise, and the available reserves are insufficient to meet such expenses, the Trust may be forced to\\nuse some or all of the Rent payments received from the Master Tenants to pay such obligations of such Operating Trust, or\\nto effect a Transfer Distribution in order to raise the necessary capital through a Springing LLC for such purposes, because\\nthe Trust itself is prohibited from raising additional capital. To the extent that the full cost of repairs or replacements or other\\ncosts must be funded out of funds received by the Trust from the Rent or from the Properties, it will negatively impact the\\nincome the Investors will receive from the Trust. There is no assurance that any additional capital for capital expenditures,\\nor other Trust obligations, would become available. In addition, construction of more than minor, non-structural\\nimprovements out of reserves established by the Trust may require the Trust to effectuate a Transfer Distribution, which may\\nhave adverse tax consequences for the Investors.\\nTitle and Survey Matters. The Properties are subject to various matters affecting title, including but not limited to,\\ncertain agreements encumbering the Properties and all matters set forth on any title commitments and surveys, zoning\\nordinances and building codes, including certain encroachments onto the Properties. The title commitment, title documents\\nlisted as exceptions on the title commitment (including such agreements), and the survey are available upon request. Such\\nmatters may include, for example, easements, declarations, restrictions and other limitations on the right of the Trust to use\\nthe Properties. In addition, other issues that are not disclosed by the title commitment or the survey may affect title and/or\\nthe use of the Properties. In connection with the acquisition of the Properties, the Trust has obtained title insurance. In the\\nevent that a known or new matter arises with respect to the Properties, however, there is no guarantee that the title insurance\\nwill sufficiently protect the Trust against all title issues affecting the Properties, that the title company will pay any claim,\\nthat the title insurance is sufficient to cover any damages, or that the Trust will not incur costs in making a title insurance\\nclaim. See “RISK FACTORS – Real Estate Risks – Agreements Affecting the Properties.”\\nAgreements Affecting the Properties. By purchasing the Properties, the Trust has become a party to various\\nagreements, including easements, declarations and restrictive covenants entered into by predecessors-in-interest which run\\nwith the land and continue to affect the Properties after they are acquired, as expected, by the Trust. The Trust may seek\\nendorsements from the title company with respect to any such easements for any loss or damage incurred by any violation\\nof such easements by the Trust. Certain of such agreements contain obligations and restrictions with which the Trust and the\\nMaster Tenants must comply. Although the Sponsor and the Trust are not aware of any non-compliance with such\\nagreements, it is possible that the Properties are in breach of the terms of one or more of such agreements. A breach of such\\nagreements could result in potentially costly litigation incurred by the Trust which would have an adverse impact on\\ndistributions made to the Investors.\\nThird-Party Reports; No Investor Reliance. Reference is made in this Memorandum to the Appraisals, the Phase I\\nAssessments, and the PCAs. These third-party reports are addressed to the Sponsor or its Affiliates and not the Trust or the\\nInvestors. These reports will be provided to Investors for reference purposes only. Individual Investors will have no\\ncontractual rights against the preparers of these third-party reports. It is currently anticipated that the preparers of the\\nAppraisals, the Phase I Assessments, and the PCAs will not issue reliance letters entitling the Trust, among others, to rely\\non them. Whether or not the Trust does obtain reliance letters, such reliance letters are not expected to entitle an Investor to\\nrely on the third-party reports. Copies of the third-party reports will be provided upon request electronically.\\nPossible Delays in Sale. The Properties could be sold or disposed of sooner than expected if the Signatory Trustee\\ndetermines it appropriate to do so based on market conditions at the time; provided, however, the Trust is required to hold\\nthe Properties for a minimum of one (1) year after the date of the admittance of the last Investor to the Trust. The Investors\\nwill not be entitled to approve a sale of the Properties or any Transfer Distribution. It may not be possible to sell the Properties\\nat the price indicated in the Financial Projections or on the projected timeline. As the Trust is prohibited from undertaking\\nany such action, the Signatory Trustee would likely be required to exercise powers under the Trust Agreement that would\\nresult in the transfer of the Properties to the Springing LLC wherein the Investors will receive a membership percentage\\nequivalent to their beneficial interest in the Trust. If the Trust is converted to the Springing LLC, the Investors’ membership\\ninterests in the Springing LLC will not qualify for future tax deferred exchange treatment under Section 1031. Fluctuations\\nin the supply of money for real estate acquisition loans affect the availability and cost of loans, and the Trust is unable to\\npredict the effects of such fluctuations on the Properties. Market conditions with respect to a sale of the Properties are also\\nunpredictable. Credit conditions have been severely restricted in the past and may become so again. If credit conditions are\\nrestricted when the Trust is attempting to sell the Properties, it may adversely affect its ability to find a buyer. If the Properties\\ncannot be sold when or for the price projected, then the Investors’ returns may be materially and adversely affected.\",\"textTemplate\":\"\",\"metadataSeparator\":\"\\n\",\"type\":\"DOCUMENT\",\"hash\":\"VYiHX18OLxaNQcIsWXX2qKicPmxcSxxFtLrcvD31poA=\"}","__type__":"DOCUMENT"},"./data/PPM - 1031CF Portfolio 6 DST.pdf_32":{"__data__":"{\"id_\":\"./data/PPM - 1031CF Portfolio 6 DST.pdf_32\",\"metadata\":{\"page_number\":32,\"total_pages\":244,\"file_path\":\"C:\\\\Users\\\\Pomelo\\\\Desktop\\\\Programing\\\\cima-prototype\\\\cima-prototype-js\\\\data\\\\PPM - 1031CF Portfolio 6 DST.pdf\",\"file_name\":\"PPM - 1031CF Portfolio 6 DST.pdf\",\"private\":\"false\"},\"excludedEmbedMetadataKeys\":[],\"excludedLlmMetadataKeys\":[],\"relationships\":{},\"text\":\"{01479718.1 } 26\\nNo Consent from Investors Required for Sale or Other Conveyance of Properties. While the Signatory Trustee may\\ncanvass the Investors regarding a potential sale or other conveyance including a 721 Exchange of the Facilities and the\\nTrust’s rights in the Properties, the Investors will have no right to consent to any such sale or conveyance. The Signatory\\nTrustee may consider the views of the Investors in good faith, but ultimately, the Signatory Trustee is not bound by the\\ndesires of the Investors as to a disposition of the Facilities and the Trust’s interest in the Properties. Thus, the Investors have\\nno control over a sale or conveyance including a 721 Exchange of the Facilities and the Trust’s interest in the Properties.\\nRISKS RELATING TO THE TRUST STRUCTURE AND OPERATING RISKS\\nLimited Experience of Sponsor. The Offering is the Sponsor’s and its Affiliates’ ninth individual offering involving a\\nDelaware statutory trust. See “MANAGEMENT.” Nevertheless, there is no assurance that the Sponsor will be successful in\\nselling some or all of the Interests, which would result in the Trust having smaller reserves than set forth in the Financial\\nProjections attached as Exhibit D. If the Master Tenants fail to operate the Properties profitably, the Master Tenants may not\\nbe able to pay the Rent. If the Master Tenants, or either of them, are unable to pay the applicable Rent and are bankrupt or\\ninsolvent, the Trust may terminate the Master Leases, or applicable Master Lease, and attempt to renegotiate the applicable\\nMaster Lease or replace the applicable Master Tenant. There is no assurance that the Trust will be successful in these\\nactivities. This could result in the Purchasers losing some or all of their investment in the Properties. The Sponsor and its\\nAffiliates are, and may in the future become, involved in other real estate projects and may make guaranties of other equity\\nor debt offerings or property-related loans in the future.\\nInvestors Have Limited Control over the Management of the Trust. The Trustees (and in particular, the Signatory\\nTrustee) are solely responsible for the operation and management of the Trust. The Investors have no right to participate in\\nthe management of the Trust or in the decisions made by the Trustees. The Trustees, the Master Tenants and the Property\\nManager will not consult with the Investors when making decisions with respect to the Trust and the Properties. The\\nSignatory Trustee is under no obligation to make its decision with respect to any prospective sale or other disposition\\nincluding a 721 Exchange in accordance with such wishes of Investors. A Trustee may only be removed by Investors holding\\na majority of the Interests, and only if such Trustee has engaged in willful misconduct, fraud or gross negligence with respect\\nto one of the Trust.\\nLimited Duties of Trustees. The Trustees do not owe any duties to the Investors other than those provided for in the\\nTrust Agreement. Specifically, the Trustees do not have a fiduciary duty to any Investors as would be applicable to a limited\\nliability company or partnership and, therefore, may take actions that would not be in the best interests of one or more of the\\nInvestors. The Trust Agreement provides that the Trustees are individually answerable for their actions to the Investors only\\nif, among other things, the Trustees engage in willful misconduct, fraud or gross negligence or any “prohibited action” under\\nthe Trust Agreement, or they fail to use ordinary care in disbursing monies to Investors pursuant to the terms of the Trust\\nAgreement. In addition, a Trustee may only be removed by Investors holding a majority of the Interests, and then only if\\nsuch Trustee has engaged in willful misconduct, fraud or gross negligence with respect to one of the Trust.\\nLimited Powers of Trustees; Risk of Termination of the Trust. To comply with Revenue Ruling 2004-86 regarding\\nexchanges under Section 1031, the Trust structure prevents the Trustees from engaging in numerous actions to the extent\\nany such action would “vary the investment” of the Investors under Treasury Regulation Section 301.7701-4(c). Those\\nactions include (a) disposing of the Properties or reinvesting money held by the Trust, except as provided in the Trust\\nAgreement, (b) entering into new financing, renegotiating the Master Lease, or entering into new leases except in the event\\nof the bankruptcy or insolvency of the Master Tenants, (c) making other than minor non-structural modifications of the\\nProperties, except as required by law, (d) after the formation and capitalization of the Trust, accepting any additional capital\\ncontributions from any Investor, or any contributions from any prospective new investor, (e) acquiring any parcel of real\\nestate other than the Properties, or (f) taking any other action that would in the opinion of tax counsel, cause the Trust to be\\ntreated as a “business entity” for federal income tax purposes. These restrictions severely limit the actions the Trustees can\\ntake on behalf of the Investors with respect to the Properties. The Trust Agreement contains similar restrictions.\\nAccordingly, in order to be able to take the actions necessary to avoid a loss of the Properties, the Trust may need to be\\nterminated and converted into a Springing LLC, which would be governed by the terms of the Springing LLC Operating\\nAgreement substantially in the form attached to the Trust Agreement (the “Springing LLC Operating Agreement”). See\\n“SUMMARY OF THE TRUST AGREEMENT.” The Properties would remain subject to the Master Leases after such\\nTransfer Distribution (unless otherwise terminated or renegotiated), and the ownership percentage of each Investor in the\\nSpringing LLC (from the Trust) would be identical to such Investor’s Interest in the Trust (subject to the impact of additional\",\"textTemplate\":\"\",\"metadataSeparator\":\"\\n\",\"type\":\"DOCUMENT\",\"hash\":\"omHDYF6jSqQI0GdiboH0w5ljM6zUomwKJ1TpPYlF+nM=\"}","__type__":"DOCUMENT"},"./data/PPM - 1031CF Portfolio 6 DST.pdf_33":{"__data__":"{\"id_\":\"./data/PPM - 1031CF Portfolio 6 DST.pdf_33\",\"metadata\":{\"page_number\":33,\"total_pages\":244,\"file_path\":\"C:\\\\Users\\\\Pomelo\\\\Desktop\\\\Programing\\\\cima-prototype\\\\cima-prototype-js\\\\data\\\\PPM - 1031CF Portfolio 6 DST.pdf\",\"file_name\":\"PPM - 1031CF Portfolio 6 DST.pdf\",\"private\":\"false\"},\"excludedEmbedMetadataKeys\":[],\"excludedLlmMetadataKeys\":[],\"relationships\":{},\"text\":\"{01479718.1 } 27\\ncapital requirements). However, as a result of such Transfer Distribution, the Investors would at such time no longer be\\nconsidered to own, for federal income tax purposes, a direct ownership interest in the Properties held by the Springing LLC.\\nSince the Springing LLC would be treated as a partnership for tax purposes, it may be difficult or impossible for the individual\\nInvestors to do a tax-free exchange when the Springing LLC disposes of the Properties.\\nSponsor and Master Tenants are Affiliates of the Signatory Trustee. The Sponsor and Master Tenants are Affiliates\\nof the Signatory Trustee, which entity has responsibility for the management, control, sale, disposition of or otherwise dealing\\nwith the Properties. Because of the affiliation between the Signatory Trustee, Sponsor and Master Tenants there may exist\\nconflicts of interest regarding the governance of the Trust that would not exist if the Signatory Trustee was an independent\\nthird-party.\\nRISKS RELATING TO THE INVESTORS\\nLiability of Investors. The liability shield afforded to an Investor in an Interest is generally respected for most purposes,\\nbarring unusual circumstances. Liability associated with the Trust, such as a claim against the Properties, should be limited\\nto the Investors’ capital and distributions from the Trust. However, under a concept known as “piercing” (commonly used\\nby courts to prevent a fraud on creditors), it is possible that a court could disregard such liability shield and impose personal\\nliability on the Investors and reach their personal assets. Prospective Investors should be aware that Delaware statutory trusts\\nare a relatively new form of legal entity and the law on “piercing” and certain other matters is still evolving. If the liability\\nshield were disregarded, the liability associated with an investment in the Trust would not be limited to the investment of the\\nInvestors, the amount of distributions to the Investors, or otherwise.\\nBankruptcy of an Investor. A bankruptcy or similar insolvency proceeding relating to any Investor may adversely\\naffect returns from the Trust to the other Investors. For example, the bankrupt Investor, or its trustee in a bankruptcy\\nproceeding, may attempt to reject and terminate the Trust Agreement or other relevant agreements. A bankruptcy filing by\\nor against an Investor generally will automatically stay all action or proceedings against such Investor. The stay generally\\nwill prevent the Trust from pursuing any claims against the bankrupt Investor and may otherwise jeopardize the Trust. Claims\\nof the Trust probably will be treated as general unsecured claims and it is unlikely that such claims would be paid in full, if\\nat all.\\nRisk of Distributions Being Paid from Other Sources; Return of Capital. The Signatory Trustee intends to make\\ndistributions to the Investors out of cash flow from the Rent paid by the Master Tenants to the Trust. Cash flow is based on\\nthe profitability of the Properties, which is beyond the control of the Signatory Trustee and is not guaranteed. See “No\\nGuaranteed Cash Flow.” While the Signatory Trustee generally intends to make distributions to the Investors out of cash\\nflow from operations of the Property, the Signatory Trustee reserves the right to make distributions out of funds on hand\\nfrom other sources. Accordingly, a portion of the cash distributed may constitute a return of each Investor’s capital\\ninvestment. Any such distribution will not constitute profit or earnings, but merely a return of the Investor’s own capital.\\nRISKS RELATING TO THE OFFERING AND LACK OF LIQUIDITY\\nIlliquid and Not Freely Transferable. Each Investor will be required to represent that he is acquiring the Interests for\\ninvestment purposes only and not with a view to distribution or resale, that such Investor understands that the Interests are\\nnot freely transferable and, in any event, that such Investor must bear the economic risk of investment in the Trust for an\\nindefinite period of time because (1) the Interests have not been registered under the Securities Act or certain applicable state\\n“Blue Sky” or securities laws; and (2) the Interests cannot be sold unless they are subsequently registered or an exemption\\nfrom such registration is available. There will be no market for the Interests and Investors holding Interests cannot expect to\\nbe able to liquidate their investment in case of an emergency. Further, the sale or other transfer by an Investor of the Interests\\nmay have adverse federal income tax consequences.\\nNo Minimum Offering Contingency. There is no minimum amount of Offering proceeds that must be raised or minimum\\nnumber of Purchasers required in connection with this Offering. Accordingly, if the Sponsor is unable to sell all of the\\nInterests, the Depositor will retain Interests. The ownership of beneficial interests in the Trust by the Depositor, an affiliate\\nof the Sponsor, involves certain risks that potential Purchasers should consider, including, but not limited to, the fact that\\nthere may be conflicts of interest between the objectives of the Purchasers and that of the Sponsor, or, if the Offering is not\\nfully subscribed, that a significant amount of the Trust’s beneficial interests will not have been acquired by disinterested\\nPurchasers after an assessment of the merits of the Offering.\",\"textTemplate\":\"\",\"metadataSeparator\":\"\\n\",\"type\":\"DOCUMENT\",\"hash\":\"G5o2MS9wdfNT3ZXneo0xlel4MlcedzLDv4sgv0iu1fM=\"}","__type__":"DOCUMENT"},"./data/PPM - 1031CF Portfolio 6 DST.pdf_34":{"__data__":"{\"id_\":\"./data/PPM - 1031CF Portfolio 6 DST.pdf_34\",\"metadata\":{\"page_number\":34,\"total_pages\":244,\"file_path\":\"C:\\\\Users\\\\Pomelo\\\\Desktop\\\\Programing\\\\cima-prototype\\\\cima-prototype-js\\\\data\\\\PPM - 1031CF Portfolio 6 DST.pdf\",\"file_name\":\"PPM - 1031CF Portfolio 6 DST.pdf\",\"private\":\"false\"},\"excludedEmbedMetadataKeys\":[],\"excludedLlmMetadataKeys\":[],\"relationships\":{},\"text\":\"{01479718.1 } 28\\nOffering Not Registered with Securities and Exchange Commission or State Securities Authorities.

Since this is a nonpublic\\noffering, prospective Investors will not have the benefit of review by the SEC or any state securities regulatory authority.\\nThe terms and conditions of the Offering may not comply with the guidelines and regulations established for real estate\\nprograms that are required to be registered and qualified with those agencies.\\nPrivate Offering Exemption – Compliance with Requirements. Each Interest is being offered, and will be sold, to\\npersons or entities in reliance upon a private offering exemption from registration provided in the Securities Act and state\\nsecurities laws. If the Signatory Trustee or the Trust should fail to comply with the requirements of such exemption,\\nincluding, without limitation, the “bad actor” provisions of Rule 506(d) that became effective on September 23, 2013 (see\\n“Prohibition on Bad Actors,” below), Investors may have the right, if they so desired, to rescind their purchase of Interests.\\nThis might also occur under the applicable state securities or “Blue Sky” laws and regulations in states where Interests will\\nbe offered without registration or qualification pursuant to a private offering or other exemption. If this were the case and a\\nnumber of Investors were successful in seeking rescission, the Trust would face severe financial demands that would\\nadversely affect them as a whole and, thus, the investment in Interests by the remaining Investors.\\nProhibition on Bad Actors. This Offering is intended to be made in compliance with Rule 506(c) of Regulation D\\npromulgated under the Securities Act. The requirements of Regulation D offerings include a prohibition on the participation\\nof certain “bad actors.” The Trust will obtain representations from the Signatory Trustee and its principals, the Managing\\nBroker-Dealer, and the Selling Group Members that the applicable party is not a “bad actor” as that term is defined in Rule\\n506(d) of Regulation D. In the event that a statutory “bad actor” participates in the Offering, the Trust may lose its exemption\\nfrom registration of the Interests. Pursuant to Rule 506(e) of Regulation D, certain events that would otherwise have\\ndesignated an Offering participant as a “bad actor,” but occurred prior to the effective date of Rule 506(d), are required to be\\ndisclosed to all potential investors. See “PLAN OF DISTRIBUTION - 506(e) Disclosure.”\\nThere is No Public Market for the Interests. An Investor will be required to represent that he, she or it is acquiring\\nthe Interests for investment purposes and not with a view to distribution or resale, and he, she or it can bear the economic\\nrisk of investment in the Properties for an indefinite period of time. The Interests are being offered and sold pursuant to\\nexemptions from the registration provisions of federal and state law. Accordingly, the Interests will be subject to restrictions\\non transfer. Even if these transfer restrictions expire or are not applicable to a particular Investor, there is no public market\\nfor the Interests, and neither the Sponsor nor the Trust will take any steps to develop a market. Investors should expect to\\nhold their Interests for a significant period of time.\\nRisk that Purchaser Will Not Acquire Interest. After identifying the Properties, a prospective Purchaser may not be\\naccepted, or may be rejected as an investor for any reason or for no reason at all and such Purchaser may therefore lose the\\nbenefit of a Section 1031 Exchange. It is suggested and anticipated that Purchasers will attempt to mitigate these risks by\\nidentifying multiple properties in connection with their Section 1031 Exchange\\nRISKS RELATING TO THE MANAGEMENT OF THE PROPERTIES\\nProperty Management. The Master Tenants have the sole right to hire or terminate the Property Manager, without\\nconsultation or notice to the Trust. If the Property Manager resigns or is terminated for any reason, there can be no assurance\\nthat the Trust or the Master Tenants will be able to obtain a successor property manager. In addition, there is no assurance\\nthat the Property Manager will be successful in operating the Properties, in which case the Master Tenants may not have\\nsufficient funds to pay the Rent. This could result in the Investors losing their entire investment in the Properties. The Master\\nTenants have each entered into separate PMAs with the Property Manager as the initial Property Manager of each Facility.\\nNo Operating History of the Master Tenants. Although the Master Tenants are newly formed and have no prior\\noperating history, the principals of the Sponsor, which is the sole member of each of the two holding companies which are\\nthe sole members of the Master Tenants, have substantial prior experience managing and operating assisted living facilities\\nand memory care centers. See “MANAGEMENT.” Nevertheless, there is no assurance that the Master Tenants will manage\\nthe Properties successfully, or that any related or third-party property managers subcontracted by the Master Tenants\\n(including, without limitation, the Property Manager) will do so adequately. If the Master Tenants are not able to operate\\nand lease the Properties profitably, the Master Tenants may not be able to pay the Rent. If the Master Tenants are unable to\\npay the Rent and are bankrupt or insolvent, the Trust will terminate the Master Leases and attempt to renegotiate or refinance\",\"textTemplate\":\"\",\"metadataSeparator\":\"\\n\",\"type\":\"DOCUMENT\",\"hash\":\"S+pSt+rT00wCr+N66re/i04OCH8yN2ZTQ8DmlkTbCFQ=\"}","__type__":"DOCUMENT"},"./data/PPM - 1031CF Portfolio 6 DST.pdf_35":{"__data__":"{\"id_\":\"./data/PPM - 1031CF Portfolio 6 DST.pdf_35\",\"metadata\":{\"page_number\":35,\"total_pages\":244,\"file_path\":\"C:\\\\Users\\\\Pomelo\\\\Desktop\\\\Programing\\\\cima-prototype\\\\cima-prototype-js\\\\data\\\\PPM - 1031CF Portfolio 6 DST.pdf\",\"file_name\":\"PPM - 1031CF Portfolio 6 DST.pdf\",\"private\":\"false\"},\"excludedEmbedMetadataKeys\":[],\"excludedLlmMetadataKeys\":[],\"relationships\":{},\"text\":\"{01479718.1 } 29\\nthe Properties, which may necessitate the conversion of the Trust into a Springing LLC, which likely would have adverse\\ntax consequences to the Investors. There is no assurance that the Trust will be successful in these activities, which could\\nresult in the Investors losing some or all of their investment in the Properties.\\nBankruptcy of the Master Tenants. In addition to a loss of Rent, a bankruptcy or similar insolvency proceeding with\\nrespect to the Master Tenants or either of them will adversely affect the Trust. For example, the bankruptcy trustee of a\\nMaster Tenant might attempt to reject one or more of the Rental Agreements between the Master Tenants and the Residents\\nof the Properties. Further, as a result of the automatic stay provided for under the applicable bankruptcy laws, the Trust might\\nnot be able to enforce a Master Tenant’s obligations under its Master Lease, or be able to reach rental payments being made\\nby the Residents under the Rental Agreements, thereby affecting the Trust’s ability to receive Rent. In the event of the\\nbankruptcy or insolvency of the Master Tenants, or either of them, the Trust will be able to terminate the applicable Master\\nLeases and negotiate a new master lease with a new tenant. Re-leasing either of the Properties to a new master tenant requires\\nincurring transactional costs which would adversely affect income to the Investors. There is no guaranty, however, that the\\nTrust will be successful in re-leasing any of the Properties to a new master tenant. Additionally, the re-leasing of the\\nProperties (or bankruptcy of the Master Tenants or either of them) may inevitably require the Trust to convert to a Springing\\nLLC, and any such conversion would likely have adverse tax consequences to the Investors.\\nConflicts of Interest. The Depositor, the Master Tenants, and the Signatory Trustee are Affiliates of the Sponsor and\\nits principals. This may lead to a conflict of interest between their various roles as owners or officers of the Sponsor, the\\nDepositor, the Master Tenants and the Signatory Trustee, including conflicts with the Investors regarding decisions related\\nto the Master Leases and the Properties. The principals of the Sponsor are employed independently of this Offering and\\nengage in other activities, including ownership and management of other senior independent living, assisted living, and\\nmemory care facilities. As such, the principals of the Sponsor will have conflicts of interest in allocating management time,\\nservices, and functions between the Sponsor, the Depositor, the Master Tenants and the Signatory Trustee on the one hand,\\nand their various other existing enterprises and future enterprises on the other. In addition, the Sponsor, its principals and\\ntheir respective Affiliates may continue to own and organize other business ventures that compete directly with the\\nProperties. There is no prohibition on the disposition of the Properties, or either of them, to an Affiliate of the Sponsor,\\nincluding pursuant to a 721 Exchange. The foregoing may result in the interests of the Sponsor and its principals and the\\ninterests of the Investors not always being aligned. See “CONFLICTS OF INTEREST.”\\nSale or other disposition of the Properties. The proceeds realized from the sale of the Properties will be distributed\\namong the Investors in accordance with their respective Interests, but only and satisfaction of the claims of third-party\\ncreditors, if any. The ability of any Investor to recover all or any portion of its investment will, accordingly, depend on the\\namount of net proceeds realized from such sale and the amount of claims to be satisfied therefrom. The total use of funds in\\nthe acquisition of the Properties is $28,400,000 while the aggregate appraised value of the Properties is $22,640,000.\\nResultingly, the Properties must appreciate from their appraised values to generate net proceeds from sale. In addition, the\\nSignatory Trustee has the right under the Trust Agreement to dispose of the Properties in a tax-deferred contribution under\\nCode Section 721 pursuant to which the Investors will receive partnership interests in the contribute partnership, rather than\\ncash proceeds from the disposition of the Properties. There can be no assurance that the Investors will receive any proceeds\\nfrom the sale of the Properties.\\nTAX RISKS\\nThere are substantial issues associated with the federal income tax aspects of a purchase of an Interest, especially if the\\npurchase is part of a Section 1031 Exchange. The following risk factors summarize some of the tax risks to an Investor. A\\nfurther discussion of the tax aspects (including other tax risks) of a purchase of an Interest is set forth under “Federal Income\\nTax Consequences.” Because the tax aspects of the Offering are complex and certain of the tax consequences may differ\\ndepending on individual tax circumstances, each prospective Investor is strongly encouraged to consult with and rely on\\nhis, her or its own tax advisor about the tax aspects of this Offering in light of that Investor’s individual situation. No\\nrepresentation or warranty of any kind is made with respect to the IRS’ acceptance of the treatment of any item by an\\nInvestor.\\nAcquisition of the Interests May Not Qualify as a Section 1031 Exchange. An Interest may not qualify under Code\\nSection 1031 for tax-deferred exchange treatment and a portion of the proceeds from an Investor’s sale of his or her property\\nto be relinquished (the “Relinquished Property”) could constitute taxable “boot” (as defined below). Whether any particular\\nacquisition of an Interest will qualify as a tax-deferred exchange under Code Section 1031 (a “Section 1031 Exchange”)\\ndepends on the specific facts involved, including, without limitation, the nature and use of the Relinquished Property and the\",\"textTemplate\":\"\",\"metadataSeparator\":\"\\n\",\"type\":\"DOCUMENT\",\"hash\":\"vtG5esr7XfrXhZh2MBtxH8FH/MJWYtBn54ndiQfLXUY=\"}","__type__":"DOCUMENT"},"./data/PPM - 1031CF Portfolio 6 DST.pdf_36":{"__data__":"{\"id_\":\"./data/PPM - 1031CF Portfolio 6 DST.pdf_36\",\"metadata\":{\"page_number\":36,\"total_pages\":244,\"file_path\":\"C:\\\\Users\\\\Pomelo\\\\Desktop\\\\Programing\\\\cima-prototype\\\\cima-prototype-js\\\\data\\\\PPM - 1031CF Portfolio 6 DST.pdf\",\"file_name\":\"PPM - 1031CF Portfolio 6 DST.pdf\",\"private\":\"false\"},\"excludedEmbedMetadataKeys\":[],\"excludedLlmMetadataKeys\":[],\"relationships\":{},\"text\":\"{01479718.1 } 30\\nmethod of its disposition, the use of a qualified intermediary and a qualified exchange escrow and the lapse of time between\\nthe sale of the Relinquished Property and the identification and acquisition of the replacement property (the “Replacement\\nProperty”). Neither the Sponsor nor its Affiliates or agents are examining or analyzing any prospective Investor’s\\ncircumstances to determine whether such Investor’s acquisition of the Replacement Property qualifies as a Section 1031\\nExchange. Moreover, no opinion or assurance is being provided to the effect that any individual prospective Investor’s\\ntransaction will qualify under Code Section 1031. Such examinations or analyses are the sole responsibility of each\\nprospective Investor, who must consult with his or her own independent legal, tax, accounting and financial advisors before\\npurchasing an Interest. If the factors surrounding a prospective Investor’s disposition of the Relinquished Property and his\\nor her acquisition of the Interests do not meet the requirements of Code Section 1031, the disposition of the Relinquished\\nProperty will be taxed as a sale and the IRS will assess interest and possibly penalties for failure to timely pay such taxes.\\nWith respect to issues of availability and timing, prospective Investors should be aware that merely designating an Interest\\nin connection with an Investor’s Section 1031 Exchange does not assure the Investor that there will be Interests available to\\npurchase when the Investor executes the Purchase Agreement and causes his or her qualified intermediary to transfer funds\\nto complete the purchase of the Interest.\\nOn July 20, 2004, the IRS issued Revenue Ruling 2004-86, 2004-33 I.R.B. 191, which held that, assuming the other\\nrequirements of Code Section 1031 are satisfied, a taxpayer’s exchange of real property for an interest in the Delaware\\nstatutory trust described in the ruling (the “DST”) satisfies the requirements of Code Section 1031. The IRS based its holding\\non the following conclusions: (a) the DST is treated as an entity separate from its owners (and not as a co-ownership or\\nagency arrangement), (b) the DST is an “investment” trust and not a “business entity” for federal income tax purposes, (c)\\nthe DST is a “grantor trust” for federal income tax purposes, with the holders of interest in the DST treated as the grantors\\nof the DST, and (d) the holders of an interest in the DST are treated as directly owning an interest in real property held by\\nthe DST. Because the holding of Revenue Ruling 2004-86 is based on numerous factual assumptions regarding the DST, not\\nall of which apply to the Trust, there can be no guaranty that an Interest will satisfy the requirements of Code Section 1031.\\nHowever, the Trust Agreement has been drafted such that it is consistent with the material factual assumptions regarding the\\nDST. In addition, Tax Counsel to the Sponsor has rendered a Tax Opinion, attached to this Memorandum as Exhibit F, that\\na holder of an Interest should be treated as holding a direct interest in the Properties for purposes of Code Section 1031. See\\n“FEDERAL INCOME TAX CONSEQUENCES” and the Tax Opinion of Tax Counsel attached hereto as Exhibit F.\\nCertain Aspects Relating to Code Section 721. Broadly, a Code Section 721 contribution may, under certain\\ncircumstances, allow for a tax-deferred exchange of property (such as the Properties) for an interest in a partnership. Code\\nSection 721 generally provides that neither the contributing partners (e.g., the Investors) nor a transferee partnership (i.e.,\\nthe partnership issuing partnership interests in exchange for the contribution of property) will recognize gain or loss, for\\nfederal income tax purposes, upon a contribution of property to a partnership in exchange for a partnership interest. The rules\\nof Code Section 721 may become relevant if, for example, the Signatory Trustee chooses to dispose of the Properties pursuant\\nto an exit strategy consisting of a Code Section 721 contribution. Notwithstanding the general rule of nonrecognition under\\nCode Section 721, a contributing partner may be required to recognize gain in certain instances. Prospective Purchasers must\\nconsult their owner tax advisors with respect to potential application or non-application of Code Section 721 to any future\\ntransaction.\\nPossible Adverse Tax Treatment for Closing Costs, Fees and Reserves. Each Purchaser of an Interest will be obligated\\nto pay its pro rata share of closing costs, reserves and other costs of the Offering, including the Acquisition Fee and\\nreallocated acquisition fee. A portion of the proceeds of the Offering will be used to pay each Purchaser’s pro rata share of\\nsuch costs. In addition, a portion of the proceeds of the Offering may be treated as having been used to purchase an interest\\nin the Trust-Held Reserve established out of the Cash Contribution rather than for real estate. Under certain conditions, these\\ncosts, as well as reserves relating to the Property, may not constitute property that is like-kind to real estate for purposes of\\nCode Section 1031. You may elect to pay these costs with personal funds separate from your Section 1031 Exchange funds.\\nBecause the tax treatment of certain expenses of the Offering, closing costs, or reserves is unclear and may vary depending\\nupon the circumstances, no advice or opinion of Tax Counsel will be given regarding the tax treatment of such costs and the\\ntreatment of proceeds attributable to the reserves, which may be taxable to those Purchasers who purchase their Interests as\\npart of a Section 1031 Exchange. Therefore, each prospective Purchaser should seek the advice of a qualified tax advisor as\\nto the proper treatment of such items.\\nTaxable “Boot.” An Investor will be obligated to pay his pro rata share of closing costs, carrying costs, acquisition fees\\nand reserves. Certain of these costs and reserves may constitute the acquisition of property that is not like-kind to real estate\\nfor purposes of Section 1031, and consequently may be treated as taxable “boot.” In addition, the IRS could take the position\",\"textTemplate\":\"\",\"metadataSeparator\":\"\\n\",\"type\":\"DOCUMENT\",\"hash\":\"zxaimdWDs8GH15sYM9mKhICdqf7YRPxNV64pNh+l98c=\"}","__type__":"DOCUMENT"},"./data/PPM - 1031CF Portfolio 6 DST.pdf_37":{"__data__":"{\"id_\":\"./data/PPM - 1031CF Portfolio 6 DST.pdf_37\",\"metadata\":{\"page_number\":37,\"total_pages\":244,\"file_path\":\"C:\\\\Users\\\\Pomelo\\\\Desktop\\\\Programing\\\\cima-prototype\\\\cima-prototype-js\\\\data\\\\PPM - 1031CF Portfolio 6 DST.pdf\",\"file_name\":\"PPM - 1031CF Portfolio 6 DST.pdf\",\"private\":\"false\"},\"excludedEmbedMetadataKeys\":[],\"excludedLlmMetadataKeys\":[],\"relationships\":{},\"text\":\"{01479718.1 } 31\\nthat any value of the Properties that may be separately allocable to any intangible property may likewise not qualify for\\nexchange treatment under Section 1031, and may be treated as taxable “boot.” Each Investor must consult his own tax advisor\\nregarding the tax consequences of such designated uses of exchange funds. An Investor may elect to pay such expenses from\\nhis own funds.\\nThe Properties were purchased without mortgage debt. Accordingly, Purchasers investing in the Trust as part of a Section\\n1031 Exchange under the Code that have mortgage debt on their relinquished property will likely incur relief of debt or\\nmortgage “boot.” A prospective Purchaser should obtain the advice of his, her or its tax advisor before subscribing for an\\nInterest or identifying the Properties as a possible Replacement Property.\\nAllocation Between Real Estate and Personal and Intangible Property. Neither the Sponsor nor the Trust are\\nproviding an allocation of the purchase price for the Properties between real estate and personal property, including intangible\\nproperty. The nature of the Properties as operating assisted living and memory care facilities is such that the valuation\\nundertaken by the Appraisers in the Appraisals includes a going concern value, which concludes an aggregate value for the\\nfee interest in the Properties based on real property, personal property and intangible property (business values) for that\\nProperties. To the extent that any material portion of the Properties constitutes tangible personal property, that portion of the\\nProperties will not qualify for exchange treatment under Section 1031. Similarly, the IRS may conclude that any value of\\nthe Properties that may be separately allocable to any intangible property may likewise not qualify for exchange treatment\\nunder Section 1031. Each Purchaser must make his own allocation of the purchase price for the Properties between real estate\\nand personal property, including intangible property, and neither the Sponsor nor the Trust make any representations or\\nwarranties as to the accuracy of such allocation by the Purchaser. Improper allocation by a Purchaser of the purchase price\\nfor the Properties could be subject to an IRS challenge upon audit and disallowance of exchange treatment as to such portion\\nof the Properties under Section 1031. Therefore, each prospective Purchaser should seek the advice of a qualified tax advisor\\nregarding the proper treatment of such items and the impact of such items on the proposed exchange under Section 1031.\\nPassive Activity, at Risk, and Excess Business Loss Rules. Losses from passive trade or business activities generally\\nmay not be used to offset “portfolio income,” such as interest, dividends and royalties, or salary or other active business\\nincome. Deductions from passive activities, including interest deductions attributable to passive activities, generally may\\nonly be used to offset passive income. Passive activities include: (1) most trade or business activities in which the taxpayer\\ndoes not “materially participate” (a statutorily defined test); and (2) rental activities (subject to an exception for taxpayers\\nwho qualify as real property operators under certain statutory tests). Subject to satisfaction of the real property operator test\\nand the material participation test, an Investor’s income and loss from an investment in an Interest, if any, will constitute\\nincome and loss from passive activities. However, the rules regarding the deductibility of passive losses (whether from an\\ninvestment in an Interest, or from another passive activity that potentially could be used to offset income from an investment\\nin an Interest) are complex and vary with the facts and circumstances particular to each Investor. Prospective Investors should\\nconsult their tax advisors with respect to the tax consequences to them of the rules described above.\\nIn addition, an Investor that is an individual or closely held corporation will be unable to deduct losses from the Trust, if\\nany, to the extent such losses exceed the amount the Investor is considered “at risk” under the Code. Losses not allowed\\nunder the at-risk provisions may be carried forward to subsequent tax years and used when the Investor’s amount “at risk”\\nincreases or when the Investor generates gain on the disposition of the activity. However, the rules regarding the applicability\\nof the at-risk rules to a particular Investor are complex and vary with the facts and circumstances particular to each Investor.\\nProspective Investors should consult their tax advisors with respect to the tax consequences to them of the rules described\\nabove.\\nIn addition, under Pub. L. 115-97 (commonly referred to as the “Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017”) (the “TCJA”), as\\nmodified by the recently enacted Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act (the “CARES Act”), for tax years\\nbeginning after December 31, 2020, excess business losses of a taxpayer other than a corporation are not allowed for the\\ntaxable year. Such losses are carried forward and treated as part of the taxpayer’s net operating loss carryforward in\\nsubsequent taxable years. An excess business loss for the taxable year is the excess of aggregate deductions of the taxpayer\\nattributable to trades or businesses of the taxpayer over the sum of aggregate gross income or gain of the taxpayer plus a\\nthreshold amount. The threshold amount for 2018 was $250,000 (or twice the applicable threshold amount in the case of a\\njoint return). The threshold amount is indexed for inflation. In the case of a partnership or S corporation, the provision applies\\nat the partner or shareholder level. The provision applies after the application of the passive loss rules.\\nPotential Requirement to Make Election to Avoid Limit on Business Interest Deductions.

While Investors in the Interests may be eligible to make this election, there is considerable\\nuncertainty as to the application of the new rules, which may depend in part upon an Investor’s specific circumstances.\\nInvestors should consult their own tax advisors as to the applicability of the new rules to them and as to their ability to make\\nsuch election. See “FEDERAL INCOME TAX CONSEQUENCES – Limit on Business Interest Deductions.”\\nIf the Trust is Converted into a Springing LLC, the Investors’ Ownership Interests in the Springing LLC will\\nnot Qualify for Future Tax-Deferred Exchange Treatment under Code Section 1031. As indicated in “SUMMARY OF\\nTHE TRUST AGREEMENT,” in order to avoid a loss of the Properties, the Signatory Trustee may be required to terminate\\nthe Trust by converting it into (or otherwise effecting the transfer of the Properties to) a Springing LLC. As a result of such\\nconversion or transfer, the Interests will be converted into membership interests in the Springing LLC, which cannot be\\ntransferred in an exchange that qualifies for tax-deferred exchange treatment under Code Section 1031. If, after the\\nconversion of the Trust into a Springing LLC, the Investors wish to engage in a tax-deferred exchange of their indirect\\ninterests in the Properties, the Springing LLC’s manager will attempt to convert the Investors’ interests in the Springing LLC\\ninto (or exchange them for) direct interests in the Properties or adopt some other tax strategy to accomplish the tax-deferred\\nexchange. However, there can be no guaranty that this will be accomplished, or that there exists any strategy that will allow\\nthe Investors to complete a valid Section 1031 Exchange once the Trust has been converted into a Springing LLC.\\nReplacement Property Identification. Section 1031 requires a taxpayer in a deferred like-kind exchange to formally\\nidentify replacement properties and to do so not later than forty-five (45) days after disposition of his relinquished property.\\nRegulation §1.1031(k)-1(c)(4) permits a taxpayer to identify multiple replacement properties. A taxpayer may (i) identify\\nthree properties without regard to the fair market value of the properties (the “three-property rule”) or (ii) identify multiple\\nproperties with a total fair market value not in excess of 200% of the value of the relinquished property (the “200% rule”) or\\n(iii) identify any number of properties if the taxpayer acquires at least 95% in value of the properties identified (the “95%\\nrule”). Identifying the Properties will use one of the possible three identifications available under the three-property rule.\\nThe identification rules of Section 1031 are strictly construed and an exchange will be completely disqualified if the\\nidentification rules are violated. (The identification requirement is deemed to be satisfied if Replacement Property is acquired\\nby the last day of the identification period.) A prospective Investor should obtain the advice of his tax advisor before\\nsubscribing for an Interest or identifying the Properties as a possible Replacement Property. The Tax Opinion will not render\\nany opinion on identification issues.\\nTaxable Income in Excess of Cash Receipts. It is possible that the income tax that an Investor owes each or any year\\nfrom the ownership of an Interest will exceed the amount of the cash distribution that the Investor receives from the\\nProperties. This may occur because income from the Properties may be used to fund nondeductible capital expenditures or\\nreserves. Thus, in certain years an Investor may have to use funds from other sources to satisfy his tax liability associated\\nwith the Properties.\\nState and Local Laws. Prospective Investors may be affected in different ways by state and local taxes that are not\\ndiscussed in this Memorandum, such as income taxes, franchise taxes, privilege and use taxes, and other taxes and fees.\\nTherefore, each prospective Investor is urged and expected to consult with his or her personal tax advisor regarding the state\\nand local tax consequences resulting to such Investor from a potential purchase of an Interest.\\nERISA Risks. ERISA and Code Section 4975 impose certain fiduciary restrictions, including prohibited transaction\\nrestrictions, on funds that hold “plan assets.”\\nThe DOL Plan Asset Rules provide that, subject to certain exceptions outlined in the rules, the assets of an entity (such\\nas the Trust) in which a Benefit Plan Investor holds an ownership interest may be treated as assets of an investing plan, in\\nwhich event the assets of the Trust (and transactions involving such assets, such as a sale of the Properties) would be subject\\nto ERISA’s fiduciary provisions, including any prohibited transaction provisions under ERISA or Code Section 4975. One\\nof the exceptions in the Plan Asset Rules will apply if ownership in the Trust is limited so that only a percentage of the\\nInterests that is less than 25% may be owned by “benefit plan investors” (as defined in the Plan Asset Rules, and hereinafter,\\n“Benefit Plan Investors”). The Sponsor and the Signatory Trustee will use reasonable best efforts to qualify the Trust for\\nthis exception to the Plan Asset Rules. If, nevertheless, Benefit Plan Investors acquire 25% or more of the Interests and the\\nPlan Asset Rules apply to the Trust, ERISA’s fiduciary standards and prohibited transaction rules would apply to the\",\"textTemplate\":\"\",\"metadataSeparator\":\"\\n\",\"type\":\"DOCUMENT\",\"hash\":\"dnpO4ADEDbaVGzltiH5UmNzurwdaV0IwlQNbh41SLhw=\"}","__type__":"DOCUMENT"},"./data/PPM - 1031CF Portfolio 6 DST.pdf_39":{"__data__":"{\"id_\":\"./data/PPM - 1031CF Portfolio 6 DST.pdf_39\",\"metadata\":{\"page_number\":39,\"total_pages\":244,\"file_path\":\"C:\\\\Users\\\\Pomelo\\\\Desktop\\\\Programing\\\\cima-prototype\\\\cima-prototype-js\\\\data\\\\PPM - 1031CF Portfolio 6 DST.pdf\",\"file_name\":\"PPM - 1031CF Portfolio 6 DST.pdf\",\"private\":\"false\"},\"excludedEmbedMetadataKeys\":[],\"excludedLlmMetadataKeys\":[],\"relationships\":{},\"text\":\"{01479718.1 } 33\\noperation of the Trust, which would likely impose substantial additional compliance expenses upon the Trust, thereby\\npotentially reducing amounts distributable by the Trust to the Investors.

The Master\\nTenants operate the Properties for their own benefit and retain certain positive differences between the operating cash flow\\nof the Properties and payments due from the Master Tenants to the Trust, as described in greater detail below. Likewise, the\\nMaster Tenants are liable for the cash shortfalls between the operating cash flow and payments due from the Master Tenants\\nto the Trust.\\nEACH PROSPECTIVE INVESTOR SHOULD REVIEW THE MASTER LEASES BEFORE INVESTING. THE\\nFOLLOWING IS A SUMMARY OF SOME OF THE SIGNIFICANT PROVISIONS OF THE MASTER LEASES. THE\\nFUNDAMENTAL INFORMATION LISTED BELOW IS NOT EXHAUSTIVE OF ALL IMPORTANT TERMS, SUCH\\nAS THE MASTER TENANTS’ AND THE TRUST’S ASSOCIATED WITH INDEMNIFICATION PROVISIONS AND\\nTERMINATION, AND RENT REDUCTION RIGHTS UNDER THE MASTER LEASES. THIS SUMMARY IS\\nQUALIFIED IN ITS ENTIRETY BY REFERENCE TO THE FULL TEXT OF THE MASTER LEASES.\\nTerm of the Master Leases\\nThe original term of each of the Master Leases is ten (10) years (the “Original Term”), commencing as of the date the\\nTrust acquired the Properties. In addition, either of the Master Tenants have the right, in their sole discretion, to exercise\\nthree (3) successive renewal terms of five (5) years each (each, a “Renewal Term,” and each, together with the Original\\nTerm, the “Term”). Each of the Master Tenants is required to give the Trust sixty (60) days’ prior written notice of its\\nintention to exercise a Renewal Term. However, the Master Tenants cannot exercise a Renewal Term if either are then in\\ndefault of the applicable Master Lease. During the Term, the Master Tenants are obligated to pay the Rent (as described\\nbelow), and generally bear all costs of operating, maintaining, repairing, and leasing the Properties, other than Capital\\nExpenses as defined in the Master Leases or expenses relating to restoration after a casualty or condemnation. Each of the\\nMaster Leases may be terminated prior to the end of the Term in the following circumstances: (a) by the Trust in the event\\nof a default by the applicable Master Tenant; (b) by the applicable Master Tenant, in the event of a default by the Trust, but\\nonly if a person not affiliated with the applicable Master Tenant is the Signatory Trustee; or (c) in the event of a material\\ncasualty and neither the Trust nor the applicable Master Tenant elects to cause such repair, or in the event of a permanent\\ntaking of all of the applicable Property (or a permanent taking of less than all of the applicable Property, but it is impractical\\nto rebuild the applicable Property), in which case the applicable Master Lease terminates automatically. Each of the Master\\nLeases will terminate automatically upon the sale of the applicable Property. Termination of either of the Master Leases may\\ncause the Trust to be converted into a Springing LLC, which would likely cause adverse tax consequences to the Investors.\\nSee “RISK FACTORS –Risks Relating to the Management of the Properties – Sale of the Properties,” “RISK FACTORS –\\nTax Risks – If the Trust is Converted into a Springing LLC, the Investors’ Ownership Interests in the Springing LLC will\\nnot Qualify for Future Tax-Deferred Exchange Treatment under Code Section 1031,” and “Summary of the Trust Agreement\\n– Terms of the Trust Agreement – Transfer Distribution and Springing LLC.”\\nRent\\nDuring the term of the Palm Coast Master Lease, the Palm Coast Master Tenant pays Stated Rent and Base Rent in\\narrears on the 7 th day of each calendar month as follows:\",\"textTemplate\":\"\",\"metadataSeparator\":\"\\n\",\"type\":\"DOCUMENT\",\"hash\":\"iDt5fkTZ9vREGjENp22fuNK+7ZAeQbmlPbicw16o1Cw=\"}","__type__":"DOCUMENT"},"./data/PPM - 1031CF Portfolio 6 DST.pdf_65":{"__data__":"{\"id_\":\"./data/PPM - 1031CF Portfolio 6 DST.pdf_65\",\"metadata\":{\"page_number\":65,\"total_pages\":244,\"file_path\":\"C:\\\\Users\\\\Pomelo\\\\Desktop\\\\Programing\\\\cima-prototype\\\\cima-prototype-js\\\\data\\\\PPM - 1031CF Portfolio 6 DST.pdf\",\"file_name\":\"PPM - 1031CF Portfolio 6 DST.pdf\",\"private\":\"false\"},\"excludedEmbedMetadataKeys\":[],\"excludedLlmMetadataKeys\":[],\"relationships\":{},\"text\":\"{01479718.1 } 59\\nPalm Coast Lease Year Base Rent* Stated Rent Total Rent\\nPalm Coast Lease Year 1\\n(Months 1-6)\\n$6,734 $366,749 $373,483\\nPalm Coast Lease Year 1\\n(Months 7-12)\\n$49,164 $366,749 $415,913\\nPalm Coast Lease Year 2 $102,260 $746,255 $848,515\\nPalm Coast Lease Year 3 $106,531 $759,012 $865,362\\nPalm Coast Lease Year 4 $110,605 $771,768 $882,373\\nPalm Coast Lease Year 5 $115,029 $784,525 $899,554\\nPalm Coast Lease Year 6 $119,630 $797,281 $916,911\\nPalm Coast Lease Year 7 $124,415 $810,038 $934,453\\nPam Coast Lease Year 8 $129,392 $822,794 $952,186\\nPalm Coast Lease Year 9 $134,567 $835,551 $970,118\\nPalm Coast Lease Year 10 $139,950 $848,307 $988,257\\nDuring the term of the Harper Lake Master Lease, the Harper Lake Master Tenant pays Stated Rent and Base Rent in\\narrears on the 7 th day of each calendar month as follows:\\nHarper Lake Lease Year Base Rent* Stated Rent Total Rent\\nHarper Lake Lease Year 1\\n(Months 1-6)\\n$8,257 $449,751 $458,008\\nHarper Lake Lease Year 1\\n(Months 7-12)\\n$60,290 $449,751 $510,041\\nHarper Lake Lease Year 2 $125,403 $915,145 $1,040,548\\nHarper Lake Lease Year 3 $130,419 $930,788 $1,061,207\\nHarper Lake Lease Year 4 $135,636 $946,432 $1,082,068\\nHarper Lake Lease Year 5 $141,062 $962,075 $1,103,137\\nHarper Lake Lease Year 6 $146,704 $977,719 $1,124,423\\nHarper Lake Lease Year 7 $152,572 $993,362 $1,145,934\\nHarper Lake Lease Year 8 $158,675 $1,009,006 $1,167,681\\nHarper Lake Lease Year 9 $165,022 $1,024,649 $1,189,671\\nHarper Lake Lease Year 10 $171,623 $1,040,293 $1,211,916\\n* The Master Tenants will not begin payment of the Base Rent, except payments related to the funding of the Trust-Held Reserve, until\\nmonth seven of each Master Lease term.\\nTotal Aggregate Rents Anticipated:\",\"textTemplate\":\"\",\"metadataSeparator\":\"\\n\",\"type\":\"DOCUMENT\",\"hash\":\"qM6ZaXuRAV96uaawEn/5+/zMenIPPcN5INXfph994Ew=\"}","__type__":"DOCUMENT"},"./data/PPM - 1031CF Portfolio 6 DST.pdf_66":{"__data__":"{\"id_\":\"./data/PPM - 1031CF Portfolio 6 DST.pdf_66\",\"metadata\":{\"page_number\":66,\"total_pages\":244,\"file_path\":\"C:\\\\Users\\\\Pomelo\\\\Desktop\\\\Programing\\\\cima-prototype\\\\cima-prototype-js\\\\data\\\\PPM - 1031CF Portfolio 6 DST.pdf\",\"file_name\":\"PPM - 1031CF Portfolio 6 DST.pdf\",\"private\":\"false\"},\"excludedEmbedMetadataKeys\":[],\"excludedLlmMetadataKeys\":[],\"relationships\":{},\"text\":\"{01479718.1 } 60\\nLease\\nYear 1\\nLease\\nYear 2\\nLease\\nYear 3\\nLease\\nYear 4\\nLease\\nYear 5\\nLease\\nYear 6\\nLease\\nYear 7\\nLease\\nYear 8\\nLease\\nYear 9\\nLease\\nYear 10\\n$1,757,444 $1,889,063 $1,926,570 $1,964,441 $2,002,690 $2,041,334 $2,080,387 $2,119,867 $2,159,789 $2,200,173\\nThe Base Rent includes certain expenses of the Trust, the Asset Management Fee payable to the Sponsor pursuant to\\nthe Asset Management Agreement, certain investor relations and administrative costs of the Trust, and the fees payable to\\nthe Delaware Trustee and Signatory Trustee under the Trust Agreement.

The possibility of the Sponsor and its Affiliates\\nreceiving these sources of income could also influence the Signatory Trustee’s decisions for reasons other than that such\\ndecisions would be in the best interests of the Trust and its investors. Additionally, these arrangements also expose the Trust\\nto the following risks, among others:\\n• the possibility that one or more of these entities might incur severe financial problems or even become bankrupt;\\n• the possibility that one or more of these entities may at any time have economic or business interests or goals that\\nare or that become inconsistent with the business interests or goals of the Trust; or\\n• the possibility that one or more of these entities may be in a position to take action contrary to the Trust’s policies\\nor objectives.\\nAcquisition of the Properties or any of them by an Affiliate of the Sponsor\\nNothing prohibits the sale or other disposition of the Properties, or either of them, including pursuant to a 721 Exchange, in\\na transaction with an Affiliate of the Sponsor. In any transaction with an Affiliate of the Sponsor, there will be inherent\\nconflicts of interest. The Sponsor anticipates any such sale or other disposition, including a 721 Exchange, would be based\\nupon the fair market value of the Properties, as established in accordance with an independent third party appraisal;\\nhowever, there is not requirement to do so and the Sponsor and its Affiliates have not established any formal procedures\\nfor resolving conflicts of interest in such transactions.\\nReceipt of Compensation by the Sponsor and its Affiliates\\nThe payments to the Sponsor, the Master Tenants, the Depositor, the Signatory Trustee and their Affiliates set forth\\nunder “COMPENSATION OF THE SPONSOR AND AFFILIATES” have not been determined by arm’s-length\\nnegotiations.\\nResolution of Conflicts of Interest\\nThe Sponsor, the Trust, the Depositor, the Master Tenants and the Signatory Trustee have not developed, nor do they\\nexpect to develop, any formal process for resolving conflicts of interest.\\nLegal Representation\\nKVCF, PLC (“Tax Counsel”) is counsel to the Sponsor, the Trust, the Signatory Trustee and the Master Tenants in\\nconnection with the Offering, and it is anticipated that such multiple representation may continue in the future.

All of the Sponsor’s prior programs with\\nsimilar investment objectives are assisted living and/or memory care facilities offered through Delaware statutory trusts\\ndesigned to offer the potential for “like-kind” tax deferral under Code Section 1031. As of the date of this Memorandum,\\nthe Sponsor’s first three prior programs have been disposed of, as discussed in more detail below.\\nThe Sponsor’s six most recent sponsored programs, Aspen Valley DST, Birchview DST, 1031CF Portfolio 1 DST,\\n1031CF Portfolio 2 DST, 1031CF Portfolio 3 DST, and 1031CF Portfolio 4 DST were launched subsequent to the advent of\\nthe COVID-19 pandemic, beginning with the Aspen Valley DST in February, 2021. Each of these programs has made\\nanticipated distributions, provided that 1031CF Portfolio 1 DST and Aspen Valley DST have each used amounts out of their\\nreserves to pay certain expenditures related to their respective facilities and operations. Subsequently, Aspen Valley DST\\nreceived government grants and COVID-19 related tax credits that enabled Aspen Valley DST to fully recover its expended\\nreserves. 1031CF Portfolio 1 DST retains approximately 90% of its initial reserves.\\nThe Sponsor’s first three sponsored programs, Rosewood DST (2018), Bandon Pacific View DST (2019) and Sunlit\\nDST (2019) launched prior to the advent of the COVID-19 pandemic. Each of these programs did not perform as expected\\nas further detailed below.\\nRosewood DST\\nRosewood DST acquired Rosewood Specialty Care located in Hillsboro, Oregon in May 2018. In July, 2021, the\\nprogram reduced distributions to beneficial owners to 5.00% as a result of the negative impact on occupancy from the\\nCOVID-19 pandemic as well as increases in operating and personnel costs relating to the same. The Sponsor has supported\\nthe rent payments by the Rosewood master tenant pursuant to contributions to the master tenant. There can be no assurance\\nthat the Sponsor would be able to support rent payments by the Master Tenant, nor does it have any obligation to do so\\nbeyond the Demand Note. In early 2022, the Sponsor terminated the former property manager for Rosewood, whom the\\nSponsor believed was not providing adequate management services, and hired Ohana Ventures to improve operations at the\\nRosewood property.\\nRosewood DST contributed the Rosewood property to Covenant REIT Holdings, LP (“Covenant Holdings”) on August\\n31, 2023 for Class A Units of limited partnership interest in Covenant Holdings (“Class A Preferred Units”). Covenant\\nHoldings’ general partner is The Covenant Diversified REIT, Inc., a Maryland corporation (“CDR”), a recently formed entity\\nwhich intends to raise capital for the formation of a portfolio of real properties and to elect to be taxed as a “real estate\\ninvestment trust” under the Code.

As a\\nresult of the negative impact on occupancy from the COVID-19 pandemic, as well as increases in operating costs, in May,\\n2022, the program paused bonus distributions to beneficial owners, but maintained the stated rent portion of distributions.\\nSunlit DST contributed the Sunlit property to Covenant Holdings on August 31, 2023 for Class A Preferred Units of\\nlimited partnership interest in Covenant Holdings. The Sunlit property was contributed to Covenant Holdings at a valuation\\nof $18,780,000, subject to closing adjustments that reduced the contribution value to $18,375,946.60.

The\\nInterests may not be resold unless they are registered under the Securities Act and registered or qualified under applicable\\nstate securities laws or unless exemptions from such registration and qualification are available. There currently is no market\\nfor the Interests and none is expected to develop. Prospective Investors should view the Interests as being a long-term\\ninvestment. In addition, a sale of the Interests must be consummated in accordance with the Trust Agreement.\\nEach prospective Investor who or which purchases an Interest shall be required, as a condition to such purchase, to\\nexecute and deliver to the Sponsor a Purchase Agreement. The Purchase Agreement provides, among other things, that an\\nInvestor represents and warrants that the Investor is purchasing the Interests for the Investor’s own account for investment\\nonly, and without any view to the distribution thereof or resale to others and that such Investor will not sell or transfer any\\nor all of the Interests without registration under the Securities Act and registration or qualification under applicable state\\nsecurities laws unless exemptions from such registration or qualification requirements are available. The Sponsor and its\\nAffiliates have no obligation to effect such registration or qualification. Generally speaking, an exemption from the\\nregistration requirements of the Securities Act would not be available to an Investor attempting to resell its Interests except\\npursuant to Section 4(a)(7) of the Securities Act or Rule 144 promulgated under the Securities Act. Neither the Sponsor nor\\nthe Trust has any obligation to assist an investor in compliance with any resale exemption.

A complete discussion of the federal tax consequences of acquiring Interests is beyond the scope of this summary.\\nProspective Investors should be aware that the income tax consequences of acquiring an Interest are uncertain and complex\\nand the consequences may not be the same for all taxpayers. Neither the Trust nor any of the Trust’s Affiliates are providing\\nany assurances or legal opinions to the effect that the acquisition of Interests by any prospective Investor will meet the\\nrequirements under Section 1031. The following summary is based on the Code, regulations enacted under the Code (the\\n“Regulations”), court decisions and published IRS rulings that are in effect on the date of this Memorandum. Future\\nlegislative or administrative changes or court decisions may significantly change the conclusions expressed below, and these\\nchanges or decisions may have a retroactive effect.\\nClassification for Purposes of Section 1031\\nThe Trust Agreement has been structured with the intent that an Investor will be treated as acquiring an undivided\\ninterest in real estate, as opposed to a security or interest in a partnership, joint venture, or corporation (collectively, a\\n“business entity”), for federal income tax purposes. An Investor who is acquiring an Interest pursuant to a Section 1031\\nExchange must be aware that the Interest must be treated as an interest in real property and not as an interest in a business\\nentity in order for an Investor to be eligible to use the Interest as part of a Section 1031 Exchange. However, no ruling will\\nbe requested from the IRS that the Interests will be treated as undivided interests in real estate as opposed to an interest in a\\nbusiness entity for federal income tax purposes. In the absence of a ruling, there can be no assurance that the IRS will treat\\nthe Interests as interests in real estate for federal income tax purposes. Consequently, an Investor acquiring an Interest as part\\nof a Section 1031 Exchange must, and is required to represent in the Purchase Agreement, that such Investor has consulted\\nhis or her own independent tax advisor about the tax consequences of any Section 1031 Exchange and its potential risks.\\nAn Interest must constitute an interest in real estate to qualify for exchange treatment under Section 1031. The\\ndetermination of whether an Interest will be treated for federal income tax purposes as ownership in real estate and not as a\\nsecurity or an interest in a business entity is dependent upon all of the surrounding facts and circumstances. On July 20,\\n2004, the IRS issued Revenue Ruling 2004-86, 2004-33 I.R.B. 191, which held that, assuming the other requirements of\\nSection 1031 are satisfied, a taxpayer’s exchange of real property for an interest in the DST may satisfy the requirements of\\nSection 1031. The IRS based its holding on the following conclusions: (a) the DST is treated as an entity separate from its\\nowners (and not as a co-ownership or agency arrangement), (b) the DST is an “investment” trust and not a “business entity”\\nfor federal income tax purposes, (c) the DST is a “grantor trust” for federal income tax purposes, with the holders of interest\\nin the DST treated as the grantors of the DST, and (d) the holders of interests in the DST are treated as directly owning\\ninterests in real property held by the DST. Revenue Ruling 2004-86 listed certain specific matters and trust provisions which\\nwould, in the IRS’s view, cause an interest in the DST to not qualify for a Section 1031 Exchange. It also contains numerous\\nfacts regarding the DST and the transactions and did not indicate which facts were key factors in the Ruling. In addition, the\\nRuling did not describe many other features of the trust agreement or factual matters that would have been present. As a\\nresult, there are some aspects of the Trust which differ from Revenue Ruling 2004-86 or are not addressed therein. For\\nexample, the Trust may be converted in certain circumstances into a Springing LLC. Notwithstanding this difference from\\nthe facts described in Revenue Ruling 2004-86, the Trust Agreement has been drafted such that it is consistent with the\\nmaterial factual matters and assumptions regarding the DST and with the existing body of law applicable to fixed investment\\ntrusts under Treasury Regulation Section 301.7701-4(c).\\nTax Counsel to the Trust has rendered a Tax Opinion that the acquisition of an Interest by an Investor should be treated\\nas a direct acquisition of the Properties for purposes of Section 1031. This opinion relies upon the accuracy and completeness\\nof certain documents, facts, representations and assumptions that may not be applicable to a particular prospective Investor.\\nIn addition, qualification of the transaction under Section 1031 requires meeting numerous statutory, regulatory and other\\nconditions and also involves issues based on facts and situations that are not and cannot be known to Tax Counsel. Therefore,\\neach prospective Investor’s tax situation with respect to an exchange will be different and a prospective Investor must consult\\nwith his or her own tax advisor regarding his or her ability to effectuate an acquisition of Replacement Property under Section\\n1031. The Tax Opinion addresses only one aspect in qualifying under Section 1031, which is whether an acquisition of an\\nInterest can be treated as a direct acquisition of the Properties for purposes of Section 1031.\\nOther issues relevant to qualification under Section 1031 that are not addressed include, but are not limited to: whether\\na prospective Investor has properly identified the Replacement Property within the 45-day time period; whether the\\nRelinquished Property qualified as being held for investment purposes or in a trade or business; whether a prospective\",\"textTemplate\":\"\",\"metadataSeparator\":\"\\n\",\"type\":\"DOCUMENT\",\"hash\":\"cE0CH0KaMJySXM8LGw1RSaWxzHOnsZcxsBBNSKbQBms=\"}","__type__":"DOCUMENT"},"./data/PPM - 1031CF Portfolio 6 DST.pdf_87":{"__data__":"{\"id_\":\"./data/PPM - 1031CF Portfolio 6 DST.pdf_87\",\"metadata\":{\"page_number\":87,\"total_pages\":244,\"file_path\":\"C:\\\\Users\\\\Pomelo\\\\Desktop\\\\Programing\\\\cima-prototype\\\\cima-prototype-js\\\\data\\\\PPM - 1031CF Portfolio 6 DST.pdf\",\"file_name\":\"PPM - 1031CF Portfolio 6 DST.pdf\",\"private\":\"false\"},\"excludedEmbedMetadataKeys\":[],\"excludedLlmMetadataKeys\":[],\"relationships\":{},\"text\":\"{01479718.1 } 81\\nInvestor will fall within the deferred exchange safe harbor rules by properly using a “qualified intermediary” and a “qualified\\nexchange escrow”; whether a prospective Investor acquiring the Properties and attempting to do a reverse exchange meets\\nall the qualifications spelled out in Revenue Procedure 2000-37, 2000-2 C.B. 308 (September 18, 2000); whether some\\nportion of the Properties is not “real property” as opposed to “personal property”; and whether any amounts paid by, or\\ndeemed paid by, the prospective Investors with respect to certain costs and expenses of the Offering, carrying costs and\\nfunding of the any reserve accounts, including the Trust-Held Reserve, will be deemed to constitute other consideration\\nreceived in the exchange.\\nTherefore, a prospective Investor must consult his or her own tax advisor regarding an acquisition of an Interest and the\\nqualification of his or her transaction under Section 1031. A prospective Investor may not rely on the Trust’s Tax Counsel\\nor on the Trust, its Affiliates or its agents, including its accountants, for any tax advice regarding the treatment of his or her\\ntransaction under Section 1031. For the same reason, except as provided in the Tax Opinion (subject to the limitations\\ndescribed therein), a prospective Investor may not rely on any statement made in this Memorandum regarding the\\nqualification of his or her purchase of an Interest under Section 1031. No representation or warranty of any kind is made\\nwith respect to the IRS’s acceptance of the qualification of a proposed Section 1031 Exchange.\\nProperty Identification for Section 1031 Exchanges\\nSection 1031 generally permits taxpayers to identify up to three (3) replacement properties (the “three-property rule”),\\nwithout regard to the fair market value of those properties. In addition, taxpayers may identify any number of properties so\\nlong as their aggregate fair market value at the end of the identification period does not exceed 200% of the value of the\\nrelinquished property on the date it was transferred (the “200% rule”). If the three-property rule and 200% rule are violated,\\nan Investor will still be treated as properly identifying any Replacement Property identified before the end of the\\nidentification period and received before the end of the exchange period if the fair market value of the Replacement Property\\nreceived is at least 95% of the aggregate fair market value of all identified Replacement Property. The property identification\\nrules of Section 1031 are complex, and Investors must consult with their own qualified intermediaries and tax advisors\\nconcerning their satisfaction of the property identification requirements of Section 1031.\\nPossible Adverse Tax Treatment for Closing Costs and Reserves\\nA portion of the proceeds of the Offering will be used to pay each Purchaser’s pro rata share of closing costs, expenses and\\nother costs of the Offering, including the Acquisition Fee and the reallocated acquisition fee. In addition, a portion of the\\nproceeds of the Offering may be treated as having been used to purchase an interest in the Trust-Held Reserve established\\nout of the Cash Contribution rather than for real estate. Under certain conditions, these costs and reserves relating to the\\nProperties, including the Trust-Held Reserve, may not constitute property that is like-kind to real estate for purposes of Code\\nSection 1031. You may elect to pay these costs with personal funds separate from your Section 1031 Exchange funds.\\nBecause the tax treatment of certain expenses of the Offering, closing costs or reserves is unclear and may vary depending\\non the circumstances, no advice or opinion of Tax Counsel will be given regarding the tax treatment of such costs and the\\ntreatment of proceeds attributable to the reserves, which may be taxable to those Purchasers who purchase their interests as\\npart of a Section 1031 Exchange. Therefore, each prospective Purchaser should seek the advice of a qualified tax advisor as\\nto the property treatment of such items.\\nReceipt of Boot\\nIf, in a Section 1031 Exchange, money is received or deemed received in addition to the like-kind property (referred to\\nas “boot”), then gain on the Relinquished Property are recognized up to the amount of boot. Although there is no direct\\nauthority on point, prospective Investors should be aware that the IRS may take the position that certain costs paid or deemed\\npaid from money received from the sale of the Relinquished Property are boot and, therefore, income to the Investors. For\\nexample, the IRS may conclude that some amounts paid in connection with the Offering of the Interests constitute boot\\nreceived by the Investors and not a reinvestment in real estate. If the prospective Investor has mortgage debt on their\\nRelinquished Property, such Investor will likely incur relief of debt, or mortgage boot, as a result of having no mortgage debt\\nattributable to the Properties and allocated to such Investor. Tax Counsel to the Trust is not opining as to whether any such\\namounts paid by or deemed paid by the Trust or the Investors will be considered an acquisition of real estate or boot to the\\nInvestors.

Such losses are carried\\nforward and treated as part of the taxpayer’s net operating loss carryforward in subsequent taxable years. An excess business\\nloss for the taxable year is the excess of aggregate deductions of the taxpayer attributable to trades or businesses of the\\ntaxpayer over the sum of aggregate gross income or gain of the taxpayer plus a threshold amount. The threshold amount for\\n2018 was $250,000 (or twice the applicable threshold amount in the case of a joint return). The threshold amount is indexed\\nfor inflation. In the case of a partnership or S corporation, the provision applies at the partner or shareholder level. The\\nprovision applies after the application of the passive loss rules.\\nLimit on Business Interest Deductions\\nUnder the TCJA, the Business Interest Limitation in Code Section 163(j) limits certain taxpayers’ annual deductions for\\n“business interest” paid or accrued during the taxable year to the sum of the ATI Limit plus certain types of business interest\\nincome of the applicable taxpayer. The rules regarding the proposed regulations under Code Section 163(j) and the Treasury\\nRegulations promulgated thereunder are highly complex and their application varies with the facts and circumstances\\nparticular to each Investor. Thus, each prospective Investor should consult with their tax advisor concerning as to the\\napplication of Code Section 163(j) to an investment in an Interest.\\nDeduction for Qualified Business Income\\nThe TCJA added Code Section 199A that generally provides that a noncorporate taxpayer can deduct twenty percent\\n(20%) of the “qualified business income” that he, she, or it receives during the taxable year. “Qualified business income”\\nis the net amount of qualified items of income, gain, deduction, and loss with respect to any qualified trade or business of\\nthe taxpayer. For taxpayers whose taxable income exceeds the threshold amount of $157,500 ($315,000 in the case of a joint\\nreturn) the deductible amount for a qualified trade or business is the lesser of: (1) twenty percent (20%) of the taxpayer’s\\nqualified business income, or (2) the greater of (a) fifty percent (50%) of the W-2 wages relating to the qualified trade or\\nbusiness or (b) the sum of (i) twenty-five percent (25%) of the W-2 wages relating to the qualified trade or business and (ii)\\ntwo and a half percent (2.50%) of the “unadjusted basis immediately after acquisition of qualified property.”\\nThere is substantial uncertainty as to whether a taxpayer’s ownership of real estate that is subject to a triple-net lease\\ncan qualify as a “trade or business” for purposes of Code Section 199A. The Department of Treasury recently issued Final\\nRegulations that provide some guidance with respect to Code Section 199A. The “Summary of Comments and Explanation\\nof Revisions” that the Department of Treasury included with the Final Regulations (the “Explanation”) discusses rental real\\nestate activities as a trade or business for purposes of Code Section 199A. The Final Regulations state that “trade or business”\\nhas the same meaning as in Code Section 162. The Explanation notes that the Department of Treasury and the IRS will not\\nprovide a bright-line rule as to whether rental real estate activities will be considered a Code Section 162 trade or business\\nfor purposes of Code Section 199A. The IRS issued IRS Revenue Procedure 2019-38 that created a safe harbor that taxpayers\\nwith rental real estate activities can, if they meet the requirements, rely upon to treat their rental real estate activities as a\\n“rental real estate enterprise” that will be considered a “trade or business” for purposes of Code Section 199A. However,\\nIRS Revenue Procedure 2019-38 specifically excludes from the safe harbor triple net leases, which are defined as agreements\\nthat require the tenant or lessee to pay taxes, fees, and insurance, and to pay for maintenance activities for a property in\\naddition to rent and utilities. IRS Revenue Procedure 2019-38 notes that failure to satisfy the requirements of the safe harbor\\ndoes not preclude a taxpayer from otherwise establishing that a rental real estate activity is a trade or business for purposes\\nof Code Section 199A. Thus, a taxpayer with a triple net lease will need to establish that his, her or its rental real estate\\nactivity qualifies as a Code Section 162 trade or business.\\nUnder Code Section 162, the determination as to whether an activity rises to the level of a “trade or business” is based\\non the facts and circumstances. The current rules with respect to Code Section 162 require a taxpayer to be an active\\nparticipant in his, her, or its real estate rental activities for the activities to constitute a “trade or business.” As the Final\\nRegulations note, a taxpayer seeking to determine whether a rental real estate activity is a Code Section 162 trade or business\\nwill need to consider factors including, but are not limited to, the following: (i) the type of rented property, (ii) the number\\nof properties rented, (iii) the owner’s or the owner’s agents’ day-to-day involvement, (iv) the types and significance of any\\nancillary services provided under the lease, and (v) the terms of the lease. The Property is subject to the Tenant Lease, which\\nmay be a triple-net lease, and Investors are expected to be passive investors in the Property.

Thus, an\\nInvestor who purchases his, her, or its Interest through a like-kind exchange under Code Section 1031 may have an\\n“unadjusted basis” in his, her, or its Interest equal to the basis he, she, or it had in his, her, or its Relinquished Property. If\\nso, an Investor who has a low basis in his, her, or its Relinquished Property will have a low “unadjusted basis” in his, her, or\\nits Interest, and his, her, or its Code Section 199A deduction amount may be less than the deduction amount of an Investor\\nwho purchased his, her, or its Interest through means other than a Section 1031 Exchange.\\nThere continues to be substantial uncertainty with respect to the application of Code Section 199A. Additionally, the\\napplication of Code Section 199A will differ based on each Investor’s facts and circumstances. Therefore, each prospective\\nInvestor should consult with his, her, or its personal tax advisor to determine whether Code Section 199A applies to the\\nincome that the Investor receives from the Trust.\\nTax Deficiency, Penalties and Interest\\nIf an IRS audit disqualifies an Investor’s proposed Section 1031 Exchange, the Investor will be taxed on his or her gain\\non the sale of the Relinquished Property, and the IRS will assess interest and could assess penalties and interest on the tax\\ndeficiencies associated with any failed Section 1031 Exchange. The Code provides for penalties relating to the accuracy of\\na tax return equal to twenty percent (20%) of the portion of the underpayment to which the penalty applies. The penalty\\napplies to any portion of any understatement which is attributable to (i) negligence, (ii) any substantial understatement of\\nincome tax or (iii) any substantial valuation misstatement. Additional interest may be imposed on underpayments relating to\\ntax shelters. As indicated above, Tax Counsel has issued an opinion that an acquisition of an Interest should be treated as a\\ndirect acquisition of the Properties for purposes of Section 1031. However, the Tax Opinion does not address whether an\\nInvestor’s specific transaction qualifies as a Section 1031 Exchange or whether any amounts paid by or deemed paid by the\\nTrust or the Investors with respect to certain expenses of the Offering will be deemed to constitute an acquisition of real\\nestate. While Tax Counsel believes that its opinion is supported by substantial authority and that an Investor should not be\\nsubject to the accuracy-related penalties described above with respect to whether the purchase of an Interest qualifies as a\\ndirect acquisition of real estate, the Tax Opinion is not binding on the IRS and does not provide a guaranty against an adverse\\ntax result.\\nTaxable Income\\nIt is possible that an Investor’s Interest will generate annual taxable income in excess of the cash distributable to such\\nInvestor. Although such taxable income can be offset by depreciation deductions, the amounts of such depreciation\\ndeductions may be limited because the tax basis of the Properties received in a Section 1031 Exchange is generally the same\\nas the tax basis of the property exchanged. Therefore, if an Investor has a low tax basis in the Relinquished Property\\nexchanged in a proposed Section 1031 Exchange, such Investor will have a low tax basis in his or her Interest, and his or her\\ndepreciation deductions will be lower than the depreciation deductions of an Investor whose purchase was not structured as\\na Section 1031 Exchange.\\nNet Income and Loss of Each Investor\\nEach Investor will be required to determine his or her own net income or loss from the Properties for income tax\\npurposes. Certain expenses of the Properties, such as depreciation, will be different for different Investors. The Signatory\\nTrustee will keep records and provide information about expenses and income for each Investor. An Investor, however, will\\nbe required to keep separate records and to separately report his or her income.\\nIn addition to other income tax imposed by the Code, the Code imposes a 3.80% Medicare Contribution Tax on the “net\\ninvestment income” of certain U.S. individuals and on the undistributed “net investment income” of certain estates and trusts.\\nAmong other items, “net investment income” generally includes rent and net gain from the disposition of investment\\nproperty, less certain deductions.\\nIncome in Excess of Cash Distributions\",\"textTemplate\":\"\",\"metadataSeparator\":\"\\n\",\"type\":\"DOCUMENT\",\"hash\":\"BBQg+roh6LuL9s4b8jr81ES0qCLO/0O+/AlNP5H0/dw=\"}","__type__":"DOCUMENT"},"./data/PPM - 1031CF Portfolio 6 DST.pdf_90":{"__data__":"{\"id_\":\"./data/PPM - 1031CF Portfolio 6 DST.pdf_90\",\"metadata\":{\"page_number\":90,\"total_pages\":244,\"file_path\":\"C:\\\\Users\\\\Pomelo\\\\Desktop\\\\Programing\\\\cima-prototype\\\\cima-prototype-js\\\\data\\\\PPM - 1031CF Portfolio 6 DST.pdf\",\"file_name\":\"PPM - 1031CF Portfolio 6 DST.pdf\",\"private\":\"false\"},\"excludedEmbedMetadataKeys\":[],\"excludedLlmMetadataKeys\":[],\"relationships\":{},\"text\":\"{01479718.1 } 84\\nIt is possible that an Investor’s income from the Properties may exceed the Investor’s cash flow from the Properties and\\nsuch Investor’s tax liability may even exceed the cash flow.\\nTaxation of Tax-Exempt Investors\\nCertain tax-exempt entities, including qualified employee pension and profit-sharing trusts, individual retirement\\naccounts and annuities, and charitable remainder trusts, are subject to taxation on their UBTI. Generally, a tax-exempt entity\\nthat incurs UBTI is taxed on such income at the regular trust, or in the case of some entities corporate Federal income tax\\nrates. Because Interests in the Trust are treated for tax purposes as direct interests in the Properties, tax-exempt investors will\\nbe deemed to be carrying on the activities of the Trust for purposes of determining whether the tax-exempt investors’ income\\nis UBTI.\\nUBTI is income that is derived by a tax-exempt entity from an unrelated trade or business that it regularly carries on,\\nless the deductions directly connected with that trade or business.\\nIf a tax-exempt Investor incurs additional debt in connection with its investment in the Trust, it may give rise to UBTI.\\nTherefore, each prospective Investor should consult its own advisors regarding the use of debt to invest in the Trust.\\nTAX-EXEMPT ENTITIES SHOULD CONSULT THEIR OWN TAX ADVISORS CONCERNING THE TAX\\nCONSEQUENCES OF AN INVESTMENT IN THE TRUST. TAX-EXEMPT INVESTORS MAY INCUR SIGNIFICANT\\nAMOUNTS OF UBTI AS A RESULT OF INVESTING IN THE TRUST.\\nTax Impact of Sale of Properties\\nIf the Properties are sold or otherwise disposed of, the Investors will likely recognize taxable income. The amount\\nrealized by the Investors will include the amount of any debt assumed by the Investor or eliminated in such disposition of\\nthe Properties, if any. An Investor will have taxable income to the extent that the amount realized by such Investor exceeds\\nhis or her tax basis in his or her Interest.\\nIf the Sponsor decides to sell or otherwise transfer the Properties, it will be paid the Disposition Fee in connection with\\nsuch sale or transfer of the Properties. The right to receive the Disposition Fee may provide the Sponsor with an incentive to\\nencourage a sale or transfer of the Properties at a time that is not optimal for, or on terms that are not advantageous to, the\\nTrust or the Beneficial Owners. The Sponsor may waive or reduce the Disposition Fee, in Sponsor’s sole discretion, in the\\nevent of an exchange transaction pursuant to Code Section 721 with respect to the Properties.\\nUnited States Income Tax Considerations for Non-U.S. Holders\\nThe federal income tax treatment applicable to a nonresident alien or foreign entity investing in the Interests is highly\\ncomplex, will vary depending on the particular circumstances of such investor and the effect of any applicable income tax\\ntreaties and can have a significant effect on such an investor. Accordingly, each foreign investor should consult his own tax\\nadvisor as to the advisability of investing in the Interests.\\nTreatment of Gain or Loss on Disposition of Interests\\nNo public market is expected to develop for the Interests. Furthermore, Investors may not be able to liquidate their\\nInterests promptly at reasonable prices, if at all, since any transferee of the Interests will be required to comply with the state\\nand federal securities laws.\\nAny gain or loss realized by an Investor upon the sale or exchange of the Interests will generally be treated as capital\\ngain or loss, provided that such Investor is not deemed to be a “dealer.” As a general rule, the holding of parcels of real\\nproperty for investment is not the type of activity that would cause a person or entity to be considered a “dealer” in real\\nproperty. The question of “dealer” status is a question of fact, will depend on the facts and circumstances of each Investor\\nand will be determined at the time of a sale of the Properties. In the event the Investor is deemed a “dealer” and the Properties\\nare not considered to be a capital asset or a Section 1231 asset, any gain or loss on the sale or other disposition of the\\nProperties would be treated as ordinary income or loss. However, any portion of the gain that is attributable to unrealized\\nreceivables (which includes, for these purposes, depreciation recapture attributable to the Properties) or inventory items that\\nhave substantially appreciated in value will generally be treated as ordinary income.

Therefore, it is possible that the gain realized\\non an Investor’s sale of the Interests may exceed the cash proceeds of the sale, and, in some cases, the income taxes payable\\nwith respect to the gain realized on the sale may exceed such cash proceeds. In the event that assets sold or involuntarily\\nconverted constitute Section 1231 assets, an Investor would combine his gain or loss attributable to the Properties with any\\nother Section 1231 gains or losses realized by such Investor in that year, and the resultant net Section 1231 gains or losses\\nwould be taxed as capital gains or constitute ordinary losses, as the case may be. This treatment may be altered depending\\non each Investor’s disposition of Section 1231 property over several years. In general, net Section 1231 gains are recaptured\\nas ordinary income to the extent of net Section 1231 losses in the five preceding taxable years.\\nForeclosure\\nIn the event of a foreclosure of a mortgage or deed of trust on the Properties, an Investor would realize gain, if any, in\\nan amount equal to the excess of the Investor’s share of the outstanding mortgage over the Investor’s adjusted tax basis in\\nthe Properties, even though the Investor might realize an economic loss upon such a foreclosure.

The\\nfollowing is merely a summary of such considerations, however, and a complete discussion of the considerations associated\\nis beyond the scope of this summary.\\nEach Benefit Plan Investor considering investing the assets of an IRA, or a pension, profit sharing, 401(k), Keogh or\\nother employee benefit plan in the Trust should satisfy himself that such investment is consistent with his fiduciary obligations\\nunder ERISA and other applicable law, is made in accordance with the documents and instruments governing the plan or\\nIRA, including the plan’s investment policy, and satisfies the prudence and diversifications requirements of Sections\\n404(a)(1)(B) and 404(a)(1)(C) of ERISA. Each Benefit Plan Investor should also determine that an investment in the Trust\\nwill not impair the liquidity of the plan or IRA and that, even though it is expected that the Interests will produce unrelated\\nbusiness taxable income for the Benefit Plan Investor, the purchase and holding of an Interest is still consistent with the\\nfiduciary obligations of the Benefit Plan Investor. See “FEDERAL INCOME TAX CONSEQUENCES” for a discussion of\\nthe unrelated business taxable income issues applicable to tax exempt investors such as Benefit Plan Investors. Each Benefit\\nPlan Investor should also satisfy himself that he will be able to value the assets of the plan annually in accordance with\\nERISA requirements.\\nTreatment of the Trust under ERISA\\nERISA and the Code do not define “plan assets.” However, the DOL has issued the Plan Asset Rules concerning the\\ndefinition of what constitutes the assets of an employee benefit plan. The Plan Asset Rules provide that, as a general rule, the\\nunderlying assets and properties of corporations, partnerships, trusts and certain other entities in which a plan purchases an\\n“equity interest” will be deemed, for purposes of ERISA, to be assets of the investing plan unless certain exceptions apply.\\nThe Plan Asset Rules define an “equity interest” as any interest in an entity other than an instrument that is treated as\\nindebtedness under applicable local law and which has no substantial equity features. Interests in the Trust offered hereby\\nshould be treated as “equity interests” for purposes of the Plan Asset Rules.\\nOne exception to the look-through rule under the Plan Asset Rules provides that an investing plan’s assets will not\\ninclude any of the underlying assets of an entity if at all times less than 25% of each class of “equity” interests in the entity\\nare held by Benefit Plan Investors. The Sponsor and the Signatory Trustee intend to take such steps as may be necessary to\\nlimit the ownership of Interests in the Trust by Benefit Plan Investors to less than 25% of the total amount of Interests, and\\nthereby qualify for the 25% exemption. If, however, neither this nor any other exemption under the Plan Asset Rules were\\navailable and the Trust were deemed to hold plan assets by reason of a Benefit Plan Investor’s investment in the Interests,\\nsuch investor’s indirect interest in the Properties would be considered a plan asset. In such event, the Properties, transactions\\ninvolving the Properties and the persons with authority or control over and otherwise providing services with respect to the\\nProperties would be subject to the fiduciary responsibility provisions of Title I of ERISA and the prohibited transaction\\nprovisions of ERISA and Code Section 4975. See “RISK FACTORS – Tax Risks - ERISA Risks” for a discussion of certain\\nconsequences if the prohibited transaction provisions of ERISA and Code Section 4975 apply to the Trust.\\nEach Benefit Plan Investor that is a prospective Investor in an Interest in the Trust should consult with its counsel with\\nrespect to the potential applicability of ERISA and Code Section 4975 to such investment and determine on its own whether\\nany exceptions or exemptions are applicable and whether all conditions of any such exceptions or exemptions have been\\nsatisfied.

The\\nFinancial Forecast was prepared based upon our assumptions, including current estimates of income and expenses\\nrelating to the operation of the Properties. We believe these assumptions to be reasonable and are not aware of any\\nmaterial factors other than as set forth in the Memorandum of which this Exhibit forms a part that would cause the\\nfinancial information not to be necessarily indicative of future operating results. However, if the assumptions with\\nrespect to the Properties do not prove correct, the Properties will have difficulty in achieving their anticipated results.\\nSome of the other underlying assumptions inevitably may not materialize and unanticipated events and circumstances\\nmay occur. Therefore, the actual results achieved during the period covered is likely to vary from the Financial\\nProjections, and the variation may be material. As a result, your rate of return may be higher or lower than that set\\nforth. Your return on your investment in the Interests will depend upon economic factors and conditions beyond our\\ncontrol.\\nThe income and cash flow forecast for the Properties and Trust, including the projected cash-on-cash return, is based\\non the Properties’ historical performance, rent roll, in-place and recent leases, and market and general economic\\nconditions. Underlying assumptions include (1) a vacancy factor of 8.0%; (2) a revenue escalation of 6.0% from year\\n1 to year 2, 3.0% from year 2 to year 3, and 3.0% thereafter; and (3) an expense escalation of 6.0% from year 1 to\\nyear 2, 3.0% from year 2 to year 3, and 3.0% thereafter.\\nThe projected availability and use of the reserves assumes: (1) capital expenditures are made as anticipated pursuant\\nto the Property Condition Assessments described in the Memorandum and (2) the Properties generate sufficient cash\\nflow to fund the additional contributions to reserves beginning in year one.\\n[See Financial Projections Attached]\",\"textTemplate\":\"\",\"metadataSeparator\":\"\\n\",\"type\":\"DOCUMENT\",\"hash\":\"Ysj3QDGNWdFWQDCKZ7xzwi8eCwuSwxsNO9jKKW5stFU=\"}","__type__":"DOCUMENT"},"./data/PPM -

The Revenue Ruling’s holding is based\\non certain factual assumptions regarding the provisions of the trust agreement of the\\nHypothetical DST.\\n1.

Under the terms of the lease, Z is to pay all\\ntaxes, assessments, fees, or other charges imposed on Blackacre by federal,\\nstate, or local authorities. In addition, Z is to pay all insurance, maintenance,\\nordinary repairs, and utilities relating to Blackacre. Z may sublease\\nBlackacre. Z’s rent is a fixed amount that may be adjusted by a formula\\ndescribed in the lease agreement that is based upon a fixed rate or an\\nobjective index, such as an escalator clause based upon the Consumer Price\\nIndex, but adjustments to the rate or index are not within the control of any\\nof the parties to the lease.

Classification of the Trust as an Entity Separate from the Investors for\\nFederal Income Tax Purposes\\nWhether the Trust is treated as an entity separate from the Investors for federal\\nincome tax purposes depends upon their treatment under local law and the nature of the\\nrelationships created among the parties to the Trust pursuant to the Trust Agreement.\\nSection 3801(g) of the Act provides that a Delaware statutory trust is an\\nunincorporated association that is created by a governing instrument for the purpose of\\nholding property for business or investment. This section further provides that “any such\\nassociation … shall be a statutory trust and a separate legal entity.” Section 3803 of the\\nAct provides that owners of a trust are “entitled to the same limitation of personal liability\\nextended to stockholders of private corporations for profit organized under the general\\ncorporation law … .” Section 3804 of the Act provides that a trust may sue or be sued, and\\nthat its property is subject to attachment and execution as if it were a corporation. Section\\n3805 of the Act provides that, except as otherwise provided in the trust agreement, a\\nbeneficial owner of an interest in a trust shall have an undivided beneficial interest in the\\nproperty of the trust and shall share in the profits and losses of the trust pro rata in\\nproportion to the owner’s percentage interest in the trust. Section 3805 further provides\\nthat no creditor of a beneficial owner has any right to obtain possession of trust property,\\nand that, except to the extent otherwise provided in the trust agreement, interests in a trust\\nare freely transferable. Section 3815 of the Act provides that a trust may merge into or\\nconsolidate with other trusts or other business entities. Section 3821 permits a Delaware\\nstatutory trust to convert to another business entity.\\nIn Revenue Ruling 2004-86, after describing certain relevant provisions of the Act\\n(including those described above), and after observing that the Hypothetical DST was\\n“formed for investment purposes,” the IRS concluded that the Hypothetical DST was an\\nentity for federal income tax purposes. We believe that the Trust is substantially similar to\\nthe Hypothetical DST. First, and most importantly, both the Hypothetical DST and the\\nTrust are Delaware statutory trusts, subject to the provisions of the Act set forth above.\\nSecond, Section 2.03 of the Trust Agreement provides that the purposes of the Trust are to\\nacquire, own, conserve, protect, manage, hold and operate of the Properties in accordance\\nwith the Trust Agreement, and to dispose of the Properties, which are consistent with the\\npurpose of the Hypothetical DST in Revenue Ruling 2004-86 (i.e., “to hold property for\\ninvestment”). Third, Section 5.01 of the Trust Agreement provides that the Investors are\\nnot liable for any liabilities or obligations of the Trust or the Trustees or for the performance\",\"textTemplate\":\"\",\"metadataSeparator\":\"\\n\",\"type\":\"DOCUMENT\",\"hash\":\"aDEcOvanc4bqj8Ucv07ijr2CsT3n4n4BAIrOHPtJSes=\"}","__type__":"DOCUMENT"},"./data/PPM - 1031CF Portfolio 6 DST.pdf_211":{"__data__":"{\"id_\":\"./data/PPM - 1031CF Portfolio 6 DST.pdf_211\",\"metadata\":{\"page_number\":211,\"total_pages\":244,\"file_path\":\"C:\\\\Users\\\\Pomelo\\\\Desktop\\\\Programing\\\\cima-prototype\\\\cima-prototype-js\\\\data\\\\PPM - 1031CF Portfolio 6 DST.pdf\",\"file_name\":\"PPM - 1031CF Portfolio 6 DST.pdf\",\"private\":\"false\"},\"excludedEmbedMetadataKeys\":[],\"excludedLlmMetadataKeys\":[],\"relationships\":{},\"text\":\"1031 Portfolio 5 DST\\nSeptember 6, 2023\\nPage 13\\n{01479475.2 }\\nof the Trust Agreement; this provision is similar to provisions in the Hypothetical DST’s\\ntrust agreement. Fourth, consistent with the Hypothetical DST, the Trust Agreement does\\nnot purport to create an agency relationship between the Investors, on the one hand, and\\nthe Trust or the Trustees, on the other.\\nC. Classification of the Trust as a “Grantor Trust” for Federal Income\\nTax Purposes\\nCode Sections 671 through 678 describe certain circumstances in which the grantor\\nof a trust or another person will be considered to be the owner of all or a portion of the\\ntrust’s assets and income for federal income tax purposes. Code Section 677(a) provides\\nthat a grantor is treated as the owner of any portion of a trust whose income without the\\napproval or consent of any adverse party or, in the discretion of the grantor or a nonadverse\\nparty (or both) may be distributed, held, or accumulated for future distribution to the\\ngrantor or its spouse. In Revenue Ruling 2004-86, the IRS held that the Hypothetical DST\\nwas a grantor trust.\\nLike the Hypothetical DST in Revenue Ruling 2004-86, the Trust satisfies the Code\\nrequirements for qualification as a grantor trusts. Section 2.04 of the Trust Agreement\\nprovides that each Investor is to be treated for federal income tax purposes as owning a\\ndirect interest in the Trust Property. Section 4.02 of the Trust Agreement provides that all\\navailable cash of the Trust is required to be distributed to the Investors pro rata in\\nproportion to their percentage interests in the Trust. Section 5.01 of the Trust Agreement\\nprovides that the Trust shall constitute a grantor trust.\\nD. Treatment of the Investors as Directly Holding Trust Property for\\nFederal Income Tax Purposes\\nIn Revenue Ruling 2004-86, the IRS held that an owner of a grantor trust that holds\\nreal property is considered to be the owner of an undivided interest in the real property for\\nfederal income tax purposes, and that accordingly, for purposes of Section 1031, real\\nproperty can be exchanged for an interest in such a grantor trust without the recognition of\\ngain or loss, assuming the other requirements of Section 1031 are satisfied. It should be\\nnoted that the holding of Revenue Ruling 2004-86 expressly assumed that “the other\\nrequirements of Section 1031 are satisfied.” We make the same assumption in connection\\nwith issuing this Opinion.\\nE. Classification of the Trust as “Investment” Trust Rather than as a\\nBusiness Entity for Federal Income Tax Purposes\\nThe Hypothetical DST was held to be an “investment” trust and not a business\\nentity. The courts and the IRS have considered the distinctions between an “investment”\\ntrust and a business entity on several other occasions. Generally, if a Trust’s trustee is\\nempowered only to protect or conserve trust property, it should not be seen as carrying on\",\"textTemplate\":\"\",\"metadataSeparator\":\"\\n\",\"type\":\"DOCUMENT\",\"hash\":\"6q7YUVpSMOFbaClqZdb1OycfBQNez3uelWRn+knMv7o=\"}","__type__":"DOCUMENT"},"./data/PPM - 1031CF Portfolio 6 DST.pdf_212":{"__data__":"{\"id_\":\"./data/PPM - 1031CF Portfolio 6 DST.pdf_212\",\"metadata\":{\"page_number\":212,\"total_pages\":244,\"file_path\":\"C:\\\\Users\\\\Pomelo\\\\Desktop\\\\Programing\\\\cima-prototype\\\\cima-prototype-js\\\\data\\\\PPM - 1031CF Portfolio 6 DST.pdf\",\"file_name\":\"PPM - 1031CF Portfolio 6 DST.pdf\",\"private\":\"false\"},\"excludedEmbedMetadataKeys\":[],\"excludedLlmMetadataKeys\":[],\"relationships\":{},\"text\":\"1031 Portfolio 5 DST\\nSeptember 6, 2023\\nPage 14\\n{01479475.2 }\\nbusiness. However, if the trustee has the power “to vary the existing investments of all\\n[beneficiaries] at will, for as long as any new money [comes] in, and in this way to take\\nadvantage of market variations to improve the investments even of the first investors,” it\\nshould be treated as carrying on business. Commissioner v. North Am. Bond Trust, 122\\nF.2d 545, 546; cf Commissioner v. Chase Natl. Bank, 122 F.2d 540 (2d Cir. 1941) (no\\npower to vary investments, so taxed as a trust); see also Continental Bank & Trust Co. v.\\nUnited States, 19 F. Supp. 15 (S.D.N.Y. 1937); Rev. Rul. 78-149, 1978-1 C.B. 448; Rev.\\nRul. 75-192, 1975-1 C.B. 384. The foregoing power-to-vary the income test was the sole\\ntest for trust income allocations under the regulations issued in 1945 until 1984. See\\nTreasury Regulation Section 301.7701-4(c) (as amended in 1986). In 1984, the IRS issued\\na notice of proposed rulemaking to define a fixed investment trust as a trust with only one\\nclass of beneficial interest. See Treasury Regulation Section 301.7701-4(c), 49 Fed. Reg.\\n18,741, 18,741 (1984). Under Treasury Regulation Section 301.7701-4(c)(1), a trust will\\nbe treated as an “investment” trust and not as a business entity if it has “a single class of\\nownership interests, representing undivided beneficial interests in the assets of the trust,”\\nand “there is no power to vary the investment of the certificate holders.” By contrast,\\nTreasury Regulation Section 301.7701-4(b) provides that a trust may be classified as a\\nbusiness entity if it is an arrangement for profit-making activity with such activity being\\nconducted either by the trustees (when the trust agreement expressly authorizes the trustee\\nto engage in such activity) or by the beneficiary (when the trustee is merely an agent of the\\nbeneficiary and the beneficiary directs the trustee to engage in such activity).\\nIn Commissioner v. Chase National Bank, 122 F. 2d 540 (2d Cir. 1941), the Second\\nCircuit held that the trusts at issue were strict investment trusts not subject to income tax\\nbecause the actual and permitted activities of the Trustee affected the property held in trust\\nonly by weeding out whatever became unsound for investment and retaining the remainder.\\nIn Chase National Bank, a depositor had transferred “units” consisting of the common\\nstock of a number of corporations to a trust, and then sold those trust certificates to\\ninvestors. The trustee was vested with all of the rights of ownership of the shares except\\nthat the depositor controlled the voting rights of the shares and the trust instrument\\ngoverned and restricted the disposal of the shares. Under the terms of the trust instrument,\\nproperty deposited into the trust was held until some disposition of it was made consistent\\nwith the terms of the trust instrument. Further, distributions of currently available funds\\nwere required. No purchases were to be made by the trustee by way of reinvestment of\\nfunds or otherwise. The IRS argued that the trust was taxable as a corporation for federal\\nincome tax purposes. The court rejected the IRS’s argument, holding that because the trust\\nagreement required the trust property “to be held for investment and not to be used as\\ncapital in the transaction of business for profit like a corporation organized for such a\\npurpose,” the trust was prevented from becoming more than a “strict investment” trust. Id.\\nat 543.\\nHowever, in Commissioner v. North American Bond Trust, 122 F.2d 545 (2d Cir.\\n1941), cert. denied, 314 U.S. 701 (1942), the Second Circuit reached a different conclusion\\nregarding the treatment of a trust for federal income tax purposes.

First, in making up new units, the depositor was not\\nconfined to the same bonds he had selected for the previous units. Second, the bonds of\\nall units constituted a single pool in which each certificate holder shared according to his\\nproportion of all the certificates issued. As a result, the money from new investors could\\nbe used to purchase new bond issues which would in turn reduce the existing certificate\\nholders’ interests in the old bond issues. Based on these facts, the court held that the\\ndepositor “had power, though a limited power, to vary the existing investments of all\\ncertificate holders at will…” (Id.), and accordingly that the trust was an association taxable\\nas a corporation.\\nRevenue Ruling 75-192, 1975-1 C.B. 384 concerned a trust agreement that required\\nthe trustee to invest cash on hand between quarterly distribution dates in short term\\ngovernment obligations or in certificates of deposit issued by banks with minimum stated\\nsurplus and capital that mature prior to the following distribution date. The IRS concluded\\nthat, because the trust agreement restricted the trustee to a fixed return similar to that earned\\non a bank account, there was no opportunity to profit from market fluctuations.\\nAccordingly, the power to invest in short term instruments described in Revenue Ruling\\n75-192 is not a power to vary a trust’s investment.\\nIn Revenue Ruling 79-77, 1979-1 C.B. 448, the IRS ruled that a trust formed to\\nhold real property was an ordinary trust under Treasury Regulation Section 301.7701-4(a)\\nand a “grantor trust” within the meaning of Subpart E of Subchapter J, Chapter 1 of the\\nCode (i.e., Code Section 671 et seq.), and not a “business entity” within the meaning of\\nTreasury Regulation Section 301-7701-4(b) (e.g., a partnership or an association taxable\\nas a corporation), where the trustee’s duties were limited to the following: (i) holding title\\nto real estate; (ii) at the direction of the beneficiaries, signing a 20-year “triple net” lease\\n(with renewal options) for the real estate; (iii) enforcing the lease; (iv) signing such other\\nagreements as are approved by the beneficiaries; (v) approving minor alterations to the real\\nestate; and (vi) distributing net income of the trust to the beneficiaries on a quarterly basis.\\nIn other situations, however, the IRS has determined that an arrangement formed\\nto hold real estate was properly classified as a business entity. For example, in Revenue\\nRuling 78-371, 1978-2 C.B. 344, the heirs to certain real estate established a trust and\\ntransferred to the trust real estate subject to a net lease. The trust agreement expressly\\nauthorized the trustees to acquire additional real estate, to sell assets of the trust, to invest\\nsuch sales proceeds in certain types of financial products, to borrow money, to mortgage\\nand lease the trust property, and to build or remove improvements from the trust property\\nwithout the knowledge or consent of the owners of the trust. The IRS concluded that the\\ntrustee’s power to engage in extensive real estate operations and to invest the sales proceeds\\nin financial products indicated that that the trust was not formed to merely protect and\\nconserve the trust’s property and ruled that the trust was taxable as a corporation.\",\"textTemplate\":\"\",\"metadataSeparator\":\"\\n\",\"type\":\"DOCUMENT\",\"hash\":\"LaoBUwn8Arb4b4DQcI6CK9m93FcjdM7r5iKcdig+quY=\"}","__type__":"DOCUMENT"},"./data/PPM - 1031CF Portfolio 6 DST.pdf_214":{"__data__":"{\"id_\":\"./data/PPM - 1031CF Portfolio 6 DST.pdf_214\",\"metadata\":{\"page_number\":214,\"total_pages\":244,\"file_path\":\"C:\\\\Users\\\\Pomelo\\\\Desktop\\\\Programing\\\\cima-prototype\\\\cima-prototype-js\\\\data\\\\PPM - 1031CF Portfolio 6 DST.pdf\",\"file_name\":\"PPM - 1031CF Portfolio 6 DST.pdf\",\"private\":\"false\"},\"excludedEmbedMetadataKeys\":[],\"excludedLlmMetadataKeys\":[],\"relationships\":{},\"text\":\"1031 Portfolio 5 DST\\nSeptember 6, 2023\\nPage 16\\n{01479475.2 }\\nRevenue Ruling 78-371 should be contrasted, however, with Revenue Ruling 75-\\n374, 1975-2 C.B. 261. In this ruling, the IRS addressed the level of joint business activity\\nthat would cause co-owners of real estate to be viewed as partners for tax purposes. The\\nco-owners of an apartment project hired an unrelated management company to manage the\\napartment project; the management company negotiated and executed the leases for the\\napartment units, collected rents and other payments from tenants, and paid taxes,\\nassessments and insurance premiums relating to the project. The management company\\nperformed (i) all services customarily performed in connection with the maintenance and\\nrepair of the apartment project (such as providing heat, air conditioning, hot and cold water,\\nunattended parking, normal repairs, trash removal and cleaning of service areas), and (ii)\\ncertain additional services such as attended parking, gas, electricity and other utilities.\\nCustomary tenant services were furnished by the management company to the tenants at\\nno additional charge above the basic rental payments. The management company paid the\\ncosts incurred in providing the additional services and retained the charges paid by the\\ntenants. The ruling concluded that the co-owners were not partners for tax purposes\\nbecause the furnishing of customary services in connection with the maintenance and repair\\ndid not render the co-ownership a partnership. The IRS also found that the management\\ncompany was not an agent of the co-owners because the co-owners did not share any of\\nthe profits realized from the rendition of the non-customary additional services by the\\nmanagement company and they did not have the responsibility to pay for the non-\\ncustomary additional services. Based on IRS’s conclusions in Revenue Ruling 75-374,\\nRevenue Ruling 78-371 should not be applicable to situations in which owners of real\\nestate (whether direct or indirect) share only in the proceeds from customary services\\nprovided to tenants.\\nWe believe that the arrangements provided for under each of the Trust Agreement\\nand the Master Leases are similar to the arrangements described in Chase National Bank\\nand Revenue Rulings 2004-86, 79-77 and 75-192, and are distinguishable from the\\narrangements discussed in North American Bond Trust and Revenue Ruling 78-371. The\\nTrust satisfies the “one class of interests” requirement because Article I of the Trust\\nAgreements expressly states that the Interests are all of one class. Section 2.03 of the Trust\\nAgreement provides the interests of the Trust in the Properties are held for investment\\npurposes only and not for the active conduct of a trade or business, and that the Trust will\\nonly engage in activities that constitute customary services in connection with the\\nmaintenance and repair of the Properties. Section 2.04 of the Trust Agreement provides\\nthat (i) the Trust Property is held for the benefit of the Investors, (ii) it is the intention of\\nthe Trustees and the Investors that the Trust not constitute a business entity for tax\\npurposes, and (iii) the Trust, each Trustee, and each Investor agrees not to take any action\\ninconsistent with the foregoing. Section 4.02 of the Trust Agreement requires the Trustees\\nto distribute available cash monthly, and permits the Trustees to only invest cash in\\ninstruments described in Revenue Rulings 75-192 and 2004-86.

Pursuant to the terms of the Master\\nLeases, the Master Tenants are responsible for all insurance, maintenance, ordinary repairs\\nand utilities, and the Master Leases may not be renegotiated unless either of the Master\\nTenants becomes bankrupt or insolvent.\\nHowever, the Trust Agreement contain provisions that were not present in the trust\\narrangement that was the subject of Revenue Ruling 2004-86 as follows: (i) the Trust will\\nnot acquire the Properties subject to the Master Leases but will be a party to such\\ndocuments, however, the Trust will not negotiate the terms or documents related to the\\nMaster Leases, but will enter into the Master Leases at the direction of the Signatory\\nTrustee, (ii) the Signatory Trustee will have an ongoing role (but no power except to\\nconserve and dispose of the Properties), (iii) under limited circumstances, the Signatory\\nTrustee may convert the Trust into a limited liability company, and (iv) the Signatory\\nTrustee will have the discretion to cause a sale or other disposition of the Properties that in\\neither respect shall cause the immediate winding up and dissolution of the Trust and the\\ndistribution of the proceeds of such sale or disposition (including any equity interests\\nreceived in connection with a Section 721 exchange of the Real Estate) in accordance with\\nSection 9.01 of the Trust Agreement. We do not believe that any such term contained in\\nthe Trust Agreement but that was absent from the arrangement that is the subject of\\nRevenue Ruling 2004-86 will cause the Trustee to have any power other than the power to\\nconserve and protect trust property. Moreover, these differences should not, affect the\\nclassification of the Trust as an “investment” trust under Treasury Regulation Section\\n301.7701-4(c)(1), because this difference should not cause the Trust to have more than a\\nsingle class of ownership interests, and should not be deemed to create a power to vary the\\ninvestment of the Investors.\\n3.

Accordingly, it is our view that the IRS used the example\\nof a fixed rental income stream to establish a “plain vanilla” arrangement so as to not have\\nto address whether the payments provided for under the lease could create a partnership\\nbetween the DST and the tenant.\\nAs discussed below, we believe that each of the Master Leases should not constitute\\na partnership between the Trust and the Master Tenant for income tax purposes. The\\ndefinition of “partnership” for federal income tax purposes is broad, and embraces\\nunincorporated jointly-owned arrangements that are not partnerships under local law. Code\\nSections 761 (a) and 7701 (a)(2) define the term “partnership” as including a syndicate,\\ngroup, pool, joint venture, or other unincorporated organization through or by means of\\nwhich any business, financial operation, or venture is carried on, and which is not, within\\nthe meaning of the Code, a corporation or trust or estate. Whether or not a joint enterprise,\\nsuch as the one between the Master Tenant and the Trust, is a partnership under state law\\nis not determinative of its status for federal income tax purposes. Thus, a joint enterprise\\nmay be classified as a partnership for income tax purposes even though it is not a\\npartnership under state law.\\nThere is no specific factor or set of factors to determine when an arrangement\\n(including a lease) constitutes a partnership for federal income tax purposes. However,\\ncourts have indicated that the most important factor is evidence that the participants in an\\narrangement intended to join together to carry on a business or venture and divide the\\nprofits therefrom. See, e.g., Commissioner v. Culbertson, 337 U.S. 733 (1949). As\\ndiscussed in greater detail below, additional factors that courts have taken into account are\\nsharing of net profits, losses, joint ownership of capital, joint participation in management\\nand filing partnership tax returns. While it is reasonably clear what types of factors are\\nlikely to be considered by the courts and the IRS in determining whether a partnership\\nexists for tax purposes, such factors are generally subjective and difficult to apply.\\nEver since Commissioner v. Culbertson, in which the Supreme Court said a\\npartnership exists when “considering all the facts … the parties intended to join together\\nin the … conduct of [a joint] enterprise,” the parties’ intent is a primary indication of the\\nexistence of a partnership. The Master Tenant and the Trust have manifested no intent to\\nform a partnership. Section 3.08 of each of the Master Leases clearly reflects the intent of\\nthe parties that each of the Master Leases are a “true lease.” Accordingly, this lack of intent\\nto form a partnership is a strong indication that the Master Tenant and the Trust are not in\\na partnership.\\nAs the Tax Court in Federal Bulk Carriers, Inc., v. Commissioner, 66 T.C. 283\\n(1976), aff’d 558 F.2d 128 (2d Cir. 1977), stated, another “central feature” of a partnership\\nis that the parties have “a proprietary interest in the net profits of the enterprise coupled\\nwith an obligation to share its losses.” Generally speaking, partners share net profits and\",\"textTemplate\":\"\",\"metadataSeparator\":\"\\n\",\"type\":\"DOCUMENT\",\"hash\":\"rqSpXmzNxgDFR8bJ+xFTz5vRlx6RJdvNOSvcMAZ2vz4=\"}","__type__":"DOCUMENT"},"./data/PPM - 1031CF Portfolio 6 DST.pdf_217":{"__data__":"{\"id_\":\"./data/PPM - 1031CF Portfolio 6 DST.pdf_217\",\"metadata\":{\"page_number\":217,\"total_pages\":244,\"file_path\":\"C:\\\\Users\\\\Pomelo\\\\Desktop\\\\Programing\\\\cima-prototype\\\\cima-prototype-js\\\\data\\\\PPM - 1031CF Portfolio 6 DST.pdf\",\"file_name\":\"PPM - 1031CF Portfolio 6 DST.pdf\",\"private\":\"false\"},\"excludedEmbedMetadataKeys\":[],\"excludedLlmMetadataKeys\":[],\"relationships\":{},\"text\":\"1031 Portfolio 5 DST\\nSeptember 6, 2023\\nPage 19\\n{01479475.2 }\\nlosses, whereas non-partnership relationships do not provide for such sharing (although\\nthey may provide for a sharing of gross revenues). See, e.g., White ‘s Iowa Manual Labor\\nInst. v. Commissioner, 66 T.C.M. 389 (1993); Harlan E. Moore Charitable Trust v. U.S.,\\n70 AFTR 2d 93-5386; IRS Action on Decision 1994 001 (IRS will no longer litigate the\\nstatus of leases providing for gross revenue sharing along with a sharing of certain\\nexpenses between tenant and landlord in the context of certain agricultural leases); but\\nsee Univ. Hill Foundation v. Commissioner, 51 T.C. 548, 569 (1969), rev’d on other\\ngrounds, 446 F.2d 701 (9th Cir. 1971), cert. denied, 405 US 965 (1972) (lease providing\\nfor sharing of net profits between landlord and tenant respected as a lease and not\\nrecharacterized as a partnership). In this case, the economic relationships between the\\nTrust and the Master Tenant should be viewed as consistent with the characterization of\\neach of the Master Lease as a lease and not as a partnership or joint venture, because Base\\nRent and Stated Rent are each payable without regard to the cash flow generated by the\\napplicable Property, subject to the Master Tenant’s ability to defer payment (but not the\\nobligation to pay) of Base Rent and a portion of the Stated Rent. Accordingly, the Trust\\ndoes not share in the losses, if any, incurred by the Master Tenant in its operation of the\\napplicable Property, and the Master Tenant is at risk for and obligated to pay the operating\\nexpenses of the Real Estate without recourse to the Trust.\\nOther elements of the relationship further indicate that the Master Tenant and the\\nTrust are not in a partnership for tax purposes.\\nIf parties combine their capital and services so that they are required to deal with\\neach other to realize the economic benefits from the enterprise, the relationship could be\\ncharacterized as a partnership. See, e.g., Bussing v. Commissioner, 88 T.C. 449 (1987).\\nHowever, the Trust and the Master Tenant do not intend to pool their capital or their\\nservices. The Master Tenant did not contribute capital to the Trust’s acquisition of the\\nProperties and there is no provision in either of the Master Leases that suggests that it is\\nbeing used by the Master Tenant to obtain an interest in the Properties. On the contrary,\\nthe Master Tenant at no time obtains an interest in the Properties.\\nAnother factor that courts have cited to demonstrate that parties are in a partnership is\\njoint participation in management. Arthur Venneri Co. v. US., 340 F.2d 337 (Cl. Ct. 1965).\\nThe Master Tenant is solely responsible for operation and management of the Properties,\\nand does not jointly manage the Properties with the Trust. The Trust’s powers over the\\nProperties are substantially limited, not only by the terms of the Master Leases (pursuant\\nto which responsibility for day-to-day management of the Properties is vested in the\\nMaster Tenant), but also by the terms of the Trust Agreement, which impose strict limits\\non the actions that may be undertaken by the Trust with respect to the Properties. Because\\nthe Master Tenant and the Trust are not sharing in the management of the Properties, the\\n“joint management” element is not present.\\nB.

Courts\\nhave consistently held that the underlying substance of the transaction, and not the form of\\nthe contract itself, dictates whether a contract will be treated as agency arrangement or\\nlessor-lessee relationship for federal income tax purposes. See e.g., Amerco v.\\nCommissioner, 82 T.C. 654 (1984). In determining whether an arrangement should be\\ntreated as a lessor-lessee relationship or agency agreement, the IRS and the courts have\\nestablished two key factors: (1) control over the use of the property; and (2) who bears the\\nrisk of loss over the use of such property. See, e.g., McNabb v. U.S., 47 AFTR 2d 81-\\n513(1980). Consistent with this case law, Code Section 7701(e) provides certain rules for\\nthe mirror image issue of when a service contract should be recharacterized as a lease. This\\nCode section specifically provides that a contract that purports to be a service contract is\\nto be construed as a lease if the contract is properly treated as a lease, taking into account\\nall relevant factors including whether or not (a) the service recipient is in physical\\npossession of the property, (b) the service recipient controls the property, (c) the service\\nrecipient has a significant economic or possessory interest in the property, (d) the service\\nprovider does not bear any risk of substantially diminished receipts or increased\\nexpenditures if there is nonperformance under the contract, (e) the service provider does\\nnot use the property concurrently to provide significant services to entities unrelated to the\\nservice recipient, and (f) the total contract price does not substantially exceed the rental\\nvalue of the property for the contract period.\\nIf a property owner retains control over the use of property and does not sufficiently\\ntransfer control to a lessee, the relationship could be characterized as an agency agreement.\\nThe issue of whether a lessee has sufficient control over the use of property is a fact-\\nintensive inquiry, but factors such as day-to-day management activities, the ability to set\\nthe terms of a sublease, and control over funds tend to indicate the existence of a true lease.\\nMere retention of supervisory functions that are necessary to protect an owner’s position\\nas a lessor-owner of property should not, without more, result in characterization of a lease\\nas an agency agreement. Freesen v. Commissioner, 84 T.C. 920 (1985).\\nIn Amerco v. Commissioner, 82 T.C. 654, the Tax Court held that contracts between\\nU-Haul and individuals who owned the trailers used in U-Haul’s business were properly\\ntreated as true leases and not management agreements. Concerning the control factor, the\\ncourt relied on the fact that U- Haul managed the day-to-day operations of the trailers, set\\nthe terms of leasing the trailers to the public, and had exclusive control over operating\\nexpenses. Id. The owners of the trailers retained the right check on their property\\nperiodically and receive periodic reports from U-Haul, but such oversight did not amount\\nto a level of control that would suggest a management contract.

As previously discussed, the Master\\nTenant is in physical possession of the Properties and is solely responsible for the operation\\nand management of the applicable Properties. Pursuant to each of the Master Leases, the\\nMaster Tenant is responsible for the day-to-day management of the applicable Properties.\\nTo the extent that there are limits on the nature of the subleases that the Master Tenant may\\nenter into, they are either consistent with the Trust’s prudent management of its properties\\nor mandated by the Lender (or both). These factors taken together are a strong indication\\nthat the Master Leases should not be treated as an agency or management arrangement.\\nIn addition, the arrangements provided in the Master Leases with respect to the\\nallocation of the risk of loss are consistent with its characterization as a lease and not as an\\nagency or management arrangement. Arrangements in which the tenant bears the risk of\\nloss, as opposed to the landlord, are likely to be respected as a true lease. Agreements which\\nprovide for rent payments only where the tenant has a net profit tend to be indicative of an\\nagency agreement. Meagher v. Commissioner, TC Memo 1977-270 (noting “[i]f this\\ncontract were held to be a lease it would be a strange one, for the ‘lessee’ would be required\\nto pay ‘rent’ only if its use of the property resulted in net profit.”). However, agreements\\nthat provide for variable rent, as opposed to fixed rent, do not preclude an agreement from\\nbeing treated as a true lease. McNabb, 47. AFTR 2d 81-513. In McNabb, the tenant’s rent\\npayments were set at thirty-five percent of the gross rentals from the property. Id. However,\\nthe tenant was responsible for paying all operating expenses out of its remaining percent\\nshare of the gross rentals and had no recourse against the landlord in the event that the\\noperating expenses exceeded the tenant’s share of gross rentals. Id. Thus, a lease which\\nprovides for variable rent based on gross revenue should not, by reason of the variable rent,\\nbe treated as an agency or management arrangement.\\nAn obligation on the part of the landlord to indemnify a tenant for damages, losses\\nor liabilities with respect to the property is also indicative of an agency relationship. In\\nMeagher, the Tax Court determined that the owner retained the risk of loss with respect to\\nthe property because the property owner had agreed to defend, indemnify, and hold the\\ntenant harmless from and against any and all loss, damage, or liability. TC Memo 1977-\\n270. Under the terms of the contract, the tenant was authorized to deduct a portion of the\\nrent payable to the landlord and reserve that amount to cover expenses associated with the\\nuse of the property. Id. The contract went one step further, however, providing that the\\nowners of the property agreed to reimburse the tenant for any expenses incurred in excess\\nof the amount held in the cash reserve allowance. Id.\\nHere, the Master Tenants have an unavoidable obligation to pay Base Rent and\\nStated Rent. In addition, the Trust has no obligation to reimburse the Master Tenants for\\nany losses incurred related to the operation of the Properties. Unlike the facts in Meagher,\\nthe Base Rent and Stated Rent are payable regardless of the actual expenses incurred by\\nthe Master Tenants in operating the Properties, subject to the Master Tenants’ ability to\\ndefer payment of a portion of each of the Base Rent and the Stated Rent and does not create\",\"textTemplate\":\"\",\"metadataSeparator\":\"\\n\",\"type\":\"DOCUMENT\",\"hash\":\"JR72ZdE4/rVk+9Ncw6v7GkWImEEAsOdnKfHr7m6QrZc=\"}","__type__":"DOCUMENT"},"./data/PPM - 1031CF Portfolio 6 DST.pdf_220":{"__data__":"{\"id_\":\"./data/PPM - 1031CF Portfolio 6 DST.pdf_220\",\"metadata\":{\"page_number\":220,\"total_pages\":244,\"file_path\":\"C:\\\\Users\\\\Pomelo\\\\Desktop\\\\Programing\\\\cima-prototype\\\\cima-prototype-js\\\\data\\\\PPM - 1031CF Portfolio 6 DST.pdf\",\"file_name\":\"PPM - 1031CF Portfolio 6 DST.pdf\",\"private\":\"false\"},\"excludedEmbedMetadataKeys\":[],\"excludedLlmMetadataKeys\":[],\"relationships\":{},\"text\":\"1031 Portfolio 5 DST\\nSeptember 6, 2023\\nPage 22\\n{01479475.2 }\\nin form or in substance any indemnification obligation on the part of the Trust in favor of\\nthe Master Tenants.\\nC. Summary -- Characterization of the Master Leases between the Trust and the\\nMaster Tenants\\nAs described above, the Master Leases should not constitute a partnership or an\\nagency/management arrangement for income tax purposes between the Trust and the\\nMaster Tenants. While it is true that the Rent structure of the Master Leases may result in\\nsome irregularity in the amount of Rent that is paid year to year, we have identified no\\nauthority under the fixed investment trust rules or otherwise that implies that an asset held\\nby a fixed investment trust is required to generate predictable cash flow. The Master\\nLeases, including its rent structure, are an inherent element of the investment being\\nacquired by Investors when they acquire an Interest in the Trust, and consistent with\\nRevenue Ruling 2004-86 the Master Leases (including their provisions regarding Rent\\npayment obligations) may not be amended except in the case of a Master Tenant’s\\nbankruptcy or insolvency. Accordingly, the Master Leases should not affect the\\nclassification of the Trust as an “investment” trust under Treasury Regulation Section\\n301.7701-4(c)(l ).\\nV. OPINION\\nBased on our review of the Transaction Documents and the aforementioned\\nassumptions, as well as our examination of applicable case law, informal policy guidance\\nfrom the IRS and the requirements set forth in the Revenue Ruling, it is our opinion that\\nthe DST Interests should be treated as interests in real property for purposes of Code\\nSection 1031.\\nOur opinion does not address and should not be viewed as expressing any opinion\\nconcerning tax treatment of the acquisition of DST Interests in light of the facts and\\ncircumstances applicable to a specific Investor under Section 1031 of the Code.\\nQualification of a transaction pursuant to Section 1031 for a specific beneficial owner\\ninvolves issues based on specific facts that are not and cannot be known to us. Therefore,\\nwe give no opinion as to the ability of any beneficial owner to effectuate an acquisition of\\nreplacement property under Section 1031 of the Code. This Opinion addresses only one\\naspect of qualifying under Section 1031 of the Code, i.e., whether the DST Interests should\\nbe treated as interests in real property for purposes of Section 1031 of the Code. We\\nexpress no opinion as to whether some portion of the Property may be “personal property”\\nrather than “real property,” or whether certain amounts that the Investors pay and are used\\nfor offering costs or expenses, financing costs, and funding reserves and impounds (as\\ndescribed in the PPM), or other items that are not attributable to the purchase of real estate\\nwill be considered taxable boot. We express no opinion as to the consequences of\\n“springing back” into the Trust following a conversion of the Trust into a Delaware LLC\\nor other transfer of either of the Properties to a Delaware limited liability company.

Specifically,\\nrather than taking the Properties subject to the Master Leases, the Trust will be a party to\\nthe Master Leases. The Signatory Trustee and the Depositor will be the issuer of the DST\\nInterests and the Investors will make multiple contributions, rather than a single\\ncontribution, to the Depositor during the marketing cycle for the offering. The Depositor\\nwill be repaid for funding the Trust which is using the proceeds of the offering to pay\\noffering expenses, fund reserves and repay the Depositor.. Although these facts were not\\npresent in Revenue Ruling 2004-86, the Trust’s structure and ownership of the Properties\\nis similar to the overall substance of the transactions described in Revenue Ruling 2004-\\n86. In addition, the Trust Agreement grants the Signatory Trustee the authority to conduct\\nactivities on an ongoing basis, including the authority to dispose of the Trust Property in\\nthe Signatory Trustee’s sole and absolute discretion and dissolve and wind-up the Trust in\\nconnection with such disposition or as otherwise provided in the Trust Agreement, to\\nprotect and conserve the Properties, and to effect a transfer distribution of each of the\\nProperties to a newly formed Delaware limited liability company in certain limited\\ncircumstances. Also, each of the Master Leases contains a provision that allows each\\nMaster Tenant to exercise up to three options to extend the applicable Master Lease for\\nadditional five-year terms. Although such options were not contained in the lease that was\\nthe subject of Revenue Ruling 2004-86, the Trustee did not negotiate such option and such\\noption does not confer on any of the Trustees the power to vary the terms of the investment\\nor to conduct business. Accordingly, the factual differences between the trust arrangement\\ndescribed in Revenue Ruling 2004-86 and the transactions described in the PPM do not\\ncause us to reach a different conclusion.\\nAs described herein, we have made a number of assumptions, and have relied on\\nthe facts and conditions set forth in the Representation Letter, the PPM, and herein in\\nrendering our opinion. Accordingly, our opinion is not a guarantee of the current status of\\nthe law and should not be accepted as a guarantee that a court of law or an administrative\\nagency will concur in the opinion. If any of the facts or assumptions set forth in the\\nRepresentation Letter, the PPM and herein prove incorrect, it is possible that the tax\\nconsequences would change.\\nIn rendering our opinion, we have considered the applicable provisions of the Code,\\nfinal, temporary and proposed regulations thereunder, pertinent judicial authorities,\\ninterpretive rulings and revenue procedures issued by the IRS and such other authority as\\nwe have deemed relevant.

We believe these assumptions to be reasonable and are not aware of any\\nmaterial factors other than as set forth in the Memorandum of which this Exhibit forms a part that would cause the\\nfinancial information not to be necessarily indicative of future operating results. However, if the assumptions with\\nrespect to the Properties do not prove correct, the Properties will have difficulty in achieving their anticipated results.\\nSome of the other underlying assumptions inevitably may not materialize and unanticipated events and circumstances\\nmay occur. Therefore, the actual results achieved during the period covered is likely to vary from the Financial\\nProjections, and the variation may be material. As a result, your rate of return may be higher or lower than that set\\nforth. Your return on your investment in the Interests will depend upon economic factors and conditions beyond our\\ncontrol.\\nThe income and cash flow forecast for the Properties and Trust, including the projected cash-on-cash return, is based\\non the Properties’ historical performance, rent roll, in-place and recent leases, and market and general economic\\nconditions. Underlying assumptions include (1) a vacancy factor of 8.0%; (2) a revenue escalation of 6.0% from year\\n1 to year 2, 3.0% from year 2 to year 3, and 3.0% thereafter; and (3) an expense escalation of 6.0% from year 1 to\\nyear 2, 3.0% from year 2 to year 3, and 3.0% thereafter.\\nThe projected availability and use of the reserves assumes: (1) capital expenditures are made as anticipated pursuant\\nto the Property Condition Assessments described in the Memorandum and (2) the Properties generate sufficient cash\\nflow to fund the additional contributions to reserves beginning in year one.\\n[See Financial Projections Attached]\",\"textTemplate\":\"\",\"endCharIdx\":2063,\"metadataSeparator\":\"\\n\",\"type\":\"TEXT\",\"hash\":\"CqqgdBuWNDYFtHtB4QjTCypgPqRr2hdOMknzTRdqcVE=\"}","__type__":"TEXT"},"705b438b-e581-4aa1-b016-998874092a25":{"__data__":"{\"id_\":\"705b438b-e581-4aa1-b016-998874092a25\",\"metadata\":{\"page_number\":184,\"total_pages\":244,\"file_path\":\"C:\\\\Users\\\\Pomelo\\\\Desktop\\\\Programing\\\\cima-prototype\\\\cima-prototype-js\\\\data\\\\PPM -
