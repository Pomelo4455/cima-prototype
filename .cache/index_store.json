The\nFinancial Forecast was prepared based upon our assumptions, including current estimates of income and expenses\nrelating to the operation of the Properties. We believe these assumptions to be reasonable and are not aware of any\nmaterial factors other than as set forth in the Memorandum of which this Exhibit forms a part that would cause the\nfinancial information not to be necessarily indicative of future operating results. However, if the assumptions with\nrespect to the Properties do not prove correct, the Properties will have difficulty in achieving their anticipated results.\nSome of the other underlying assumptions inevitably may not materialize and unanticipated events and circumstances\nmay occur. Therefore, the actual results achieved during the period covered is likely to vary from the Financial\nProjections, and the variation may be material. As a result, your rate of return may be higher or lower than that set\nforth. Your return on your investment in the Interests will depend upon economic factors and conditions beyond our\ncontrol.\nThe income and cash flow forecast for the Properties and Trust, including the projected cash-on-cash return, is based\non the Properties’ historical performance, rent roll, in-place and recent leases, and market and general economic\nconditions. Underlying assumptions include (1) a vacancy factor of 8.0%; (2) a revenue escalation of 6.0% from year\n1 to year 2, 3.0% from year 2 to year 3, and 3.0% thereafter; and (3) an expense escalation of 6.0% from year 1 to\nyear 2, 3.0% from year 2 to year 3, and 3.0% thereafter.\nThe projected availability and use of the reserves assumes: (1) capital expenditures are made as anticipated pursuant\nto the Property Condition Assessments described in the Memorandum and (2) the Properties generate sufficient cash\nflow to fund the additional contributions to reserves beginning in year one.\n[See Financial Projections Attached]","textTemplate":"","endCharIdx":2063,"metadataSeparator":"\n","type":"TEXT","hash":"CqqgdBuWNDYFtHtB4QjTCypgPqRr2hdOMknzTRdqcVE="},"705b438b-e581-4aa1-b016-998874092a25":{"id_":"705b438b-e581-4aa1-b016-998874092a25","metadata":{"page_number":184,"total_pages":244,"file_path":"C:\\Users\\Pomelo\\Desktop\\Programing\\cima-prototype\\cima-prototype-js\\data\\PPM -

WARNING ABOUT FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS\nThis Memorandum contains statements about operating and financial plans, performance of the Properties,\nregulatory compliance and litigation, and projections of future results.Forward-looking statements may be identified\nby the use of words such as “expects,” “anticipates,” “intends,” “plans,” “will,” “may” and similar expressions.The\n“forward-looking” statements are based on various assumptions, for example, the growth and expansion of the\neconomy, projected financing environment and real property market value trends, regulatory enforcement, and third-\nparty behavior, and these assumptions may prove to be incorrect.Accordingly, while the Sponsor believes these\nassumptions to be reasonable under the circumstances existing at the time they were made, such forward-looking\nstatements might not accurately predict future events or the actual performance of an investment in the Interests.Factors that could cause forward-looking statements to be incorrect include changes in the economy or the markets\nwhere we operate, developments in litigation, changes in regulatory frameworks, and other factors discussed more\ncompletely in the risk factors section of this Memorandum.In addition, you must disregard any projections and\nrepresentations, written or oral, which do not conform to those contained in this Memorandum.MARKET DATA\nThe

fees and interest and operating reserves), which loans\nwere collateralized by the relevant GenV Storage Facility, carried a fixed rate of interest, and included a profits interest\nentitling JCAP to 49.9% of cash flow from operations and capital events of the relevant GenV Storage Facility.In\naddition, JCAP received a right of first refusal to acquire each GenV Storage Facility it

connection with a Section 1031 Exchange, and upon a sale of\none or more of the Properties, engage in a subsequent like-kind exchange (assuming the tax status of the DST remains\nunchanged).The DST structure provides certain advantages over a tenant-in-common structure.Some of the\nadvantages of owning property under the DST structure are (1) more favorable financing terms (where

million.The total aggregate purchase price of\n$42,097,798 for the Properties (including costs and fees) is lower than the $46,439,932 aggregate purchase price of\nthe Interests.See “Estimated Use of

assessment report generally will not involve any invasive testing, but instead is\nlimited to a physical walk through or inspection of a Property (and, where applicable, the land parcel on which the\nProperty is located) and a review of the related governmental records.Accordingly, the Sponsor cannot provide any\nassurance to potential Purchasers that actual environmental problems with any of the Properties would be exposed by\ntheir respective Phase I Reports.In light of the material risks and potential liability associated with the discovery of\nan environmental hazard at the Properties, the Purchasers of the Interests should be certain that they understand, and\ncan accept, the risks associated with any known and unknown hazardous substances affecting the Properties.In\naddition, it is possible that an environmental claim may be raised in such a manner that liability could penetrate any\nlimited liability protections otherwise available to shield the owners of an entity from liability, thereby allowing such\nclaims to be enforceable against the Purchasers.","textTemplate":"","metadataSeparator":"\n","type":"TEXT","hash":"adoJyMEFCF79sdMeXAAFKXmx5TWPIualaclt27W3xgE="},"420709ca-b12c-424a-a018-4aeb008707f6":{"id_":"420709ca-b12c-424a-a018-4aeb008707f6","metadata":{"page_number":45,"total_pages":232,"file_name":"NexPoint_Storage_V_DST_a2ffe4a7-0107-4021-8d82-86dec779f2e0.pdf","private":"true"},"excludedEmbedMetadataKeys":[],"excludedLlmMetadataKeys":[],"relationships":{"SOURCE":{"nodeId":"041706b5-0f72-4c80-9ee0-d099a714ff81","metadata":{"page_number":45,"total_pages":232,"file_name":"NexPoint_Storage_V_DST_a2ffe4a7-0107-4021-8d82-86dec779f2e0.pdf","private":"true"},"hash":"XwYRkJg5eoRjoeQ/FLyEXFH8or9hhjFeZ7Rf91XtyKU="},"PREVIOUS":{"nodeId":"b182f521-8678-4f4d-b55a-2bc027ca06b4","metadata":{"page_number":45,"total_pages":232,"file_name":"NexPoint_Storage_V_DST_a2ffe4a7-0107-4021-8d82-86dec779f2e0.pdf","private":"true"},"hash":"adoJyMEFCF79sdMeXAAFKXmx5TWPIualaclt27W3xgE="},"NEXT":{"nodeId":"4a737e20-91f5-4f20-bed5-40b667d318ec","metadata":{},"hash":"tAvs0+OUE0o6E14uUEWgosAvu4z7iA9E8mvvNj5Ihv0="}},"text":"Finally,

Risks\nNo Public Market for Interests.The transfer of Interests will be subject to certain limitations.See\n“Summary of the Trust Agreements – Transfer Rights; Rights of First Refusal.”Moreover, it is not anticipated that\nany public market for Interests will develop, and the transfer of Interests may result in adverse tax consequences for\nthe transferor.See “Federal Income Tax Consequences.”Consequently, Purchasers of Interests may not be able to\nliquidate their investments in the event of emergency or for any other reason.Moreover, Purchasers are specifically\nnotified that Interests are not likely to be readily accepted as collateral for outside financing.Any purchase of Interests,\ntherefore, should be considered only as a long-term investment.Purchase Price of Interests.The purchase price of the Interests is based on the purchase price and\nAppraisals of the Properties, and includes Sales Commissions and Expenses, Other Closing Costs, and the Facilitation\nFee.If the Operating Trusts are unable to sell the Properties at a price which would net (after repayment of other\napplicable expenses) at least the aggregate of the purchase price paid for the Interests, the Purchasers would suffer a\nloss on their investment.Risk that Purchaser Will Not Acquire Interest.After identifying the Properties, a prospective Purchaser\nmay not be accepted, or may be rejected as an investor for any reason or for no reason at all and such Purchaser may\ntherefore lose the benefit of a Section 1031 Exchange.It is suggested and anticipated that Purchasers will attempt to\nmitigate these risks by identifying multiple properties in connection with their Section 1031 Exchange.Impact of Leverage on Section 1031 Exchange.The Properties are not subject to financing.Code Section\n1031 generally requires taxpayers to offset debt on their relinquished property with equal or greater debt on their\nreplacement property (or additional cash from another

on the following conclusions: (1) the DST is treated as an entity separate from its owners (and not as a co-\nownership or agency arrangement); (2) the DST is an “investment” trust and not a “business entity” for federal income\ntax purposes; (3) the DST is a “grantor trust” for federal income tax purposes, with the holders of Interests in the DST\ntreated as the grantors of the DST; and (4) the holders of Interests in the DST are treated as directly owning Interests\nin real property held by the DST.There are no authorities that directly address the tax treatment of the Trusts other\nthan Revenue Ruling 2004-86.It is possible that the IRS could revoke Revenue Ruling 2004-86 or, in the alternative,\ndetermine that the Trusts do not comply with the requirements of that ruling or the underlying authorities.A\ndetermination that a Trust is not taxable as a trust (within the meaning of Treasury Regulations Section 301.7701-4)\nlikely would have a significant adverse impact on the Beneficial Owners.Because the holding of Revenue Ruling\n2004-86 is based on certain factual assumptions regarding the DST, not all of which apply to the Trusts, and because\nthere are provisions in the Trust Agreements which are not mentioned in the limited facts laid out in the ruling, there\ncan be no guarantee that the Interests will satisfy the requirements of Code Section 1031.Classification for Purposes of Code Section 1031; No Ruling.We believe the Offering described in this\nMemorandum is structured in a manner that the Interests should be treated for federal income tax purposes as direct\nownership interests in real estate and not as interests in a partnership.If the Interests were to be treated by the IRS or\na court as interests in a partnership, then no

2004-86.However,\ndistinctions exist between the Trust Agreements and other related arrangements and the trust and other related\narrangements described in Revenue Ruling 2004-86.Tax Counsel believes these distinctions are not material.If,\nhowever, the IRS or a court were to disagree with the opinion of Tax Counsel, the Interests may be treated for federal\nincome tax purposes as interests in a partnership and not as interests in real estate, and Purchasers would not be able\nto use their acquisition of Interests as part of a Section 1031 Exchange to defer gain under Code Section 1031.For a\ncomplete discussion of the Trust in comparison to the arrangement described in Revenue Ruling 2004-86, please see\nthe attached opinion of Tax Counsel.Status as True Leases for Federal Income Tax Purposes.Transactions structured as leases may be\nrecharacterized for federal income tax purposes to reflect their economic substance.For example, in appropriate\ncircumstances a purported lease of property may be recharacterized as a sale of the property providing for deferred\npayments.Such a recharacterization in this context would have significant (and adverse) tax consequences.","textTemplate":"","metadataSeparator":"\n","type":"TEXT","hash":"U+85CscGleCLdO1ocaxE4nBelXNzP8nUXvcqg3/dvv8="},"7ef924c4-eb50-44db-919f-270493a13259":{"id_":"7ef924c4-eb50-44db-919f-270493a13259","metadata":{"page_number":56,"total_pages":232,"file_name":"NexPoint_Storage_V_DST_a2ffe4a7-0107-4021-8d82-86dec779f2e0.pdf","private":"true"},"excludedEmbedMetadataKeys":[],"excludedLlmMetadataKeys":[],"relationships":{"SOURCE":{"nodeId":"ecddc410-4bb6-430b-8231-3eacfefa4d7d","metadata":{"page_number":56,"total_pages":232,"file_name":"NexPoint_Storage_V_DST_a2ffe4a7-0107-4021-8d82-86dec779f2e0.pdf","private":"true"},"hash":"5pY0oSAjpOW2744bEom4Ju2AOa223K24uZQaA0BzBaE="},"PREVIOUS":{"nodeId":"2d712f75-74a9-4753-b6ab-3d65e1cacf9f","metadata":{"page_number":56,"total_pages":232,"file_name":"NexPoint_Storage_V_DST_a2ffe4a7-0107-4021-8d82-86dec779f2e0.pdf","private":"true"},"hash":"U+85CscGleCLdO1ocaxE4nBelXNzP8nUXvcqg3/dvv8="},"NEXT":{"nodeId":"c29954b8-030f-4dfd-ad8e-b83f8434c202","metadata":{},"hash":"J7jRpIjbzHzYXLHkC5EY5hvGsBkEnlmcOZJPEmevAJY="}},"text":"Such

the U.S.Congress periodically evaluates various proposed modifications to the Section 1031 Exchange\nrules that could, if enacted, prospectively repeal or restrict the ability to utilize a Section 1031 Exchange to achieve\ntax deferral on gain in connection with the disposition of real property or beneficial interests in a fixed investment\ntrust.Any such change may or may not be retroactive with respect to transactions entered into or contemplated before\nthe effective date of such change and could have a material adverse effect on an investment in an Interest.The rules dealing with federal income taxation are constantly under review by persons involved in the\nlegislative process and by the IRS and the Treasury, resulting in revisions of resolutions and revised interpretations of\nestablished concepts as well as statutory changes.In particular, the TCJA, which generally took effect for taxable\nyears beginning on or after January 1, 2018 (subject to certain exceptions), made many significant changes to the\nfederal income tax laws.Further, the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act (the “CARES Act”) and\nthe Inflation Reduction Act (the “IRA”) have revised certain provisions of the Code, many with retroactive effect.To\ndate, the IRS has issued only limited guidance with respect to certain of the new provisions, and there are numerous\ninterpretive issues that will require guidance.Technical corrections legislation may be needed to clarify certain aspects\nof the new law and give proper effect to Congressional intent.There can be no assurance, however, that technical\nclarifications or changes needed to prevent unintended or unforeseen tax consequences will be enacted by Congress\nin the near future.An investment in an Interest involving solely real property was not impacted by the TCJA or the CARES\nAct.Specifically, subject to certain transition rules, for transfers effective after December 31, 2017, Section 1031\nExchanges are only allowed with respect to real property that is not held primarily for sale.Generally, tangible\npersonal property and intangible property are no longer eligible for Section 1031 Exchanges.","textTemplate":"","metadataSeparator":"\n","type":"TEXT","hash":"B9x4VkWIvFLPTDo/rllrsyF2UaJGoBlXrYHklgY8rUQ="},"349d2d5d-6f6b-4ee3-b313-c51442ac261b":{"id_":"349d2d5d-6f6b-4ee3-b313-c51442ac261b","metadata":{"page_number":59,"total_pages":232,"file_name":"NexPoint_Storage_V_DST_a2ffe4a7-0107-4021-8d82-86dec779f2e0.pdf","private":"true"},"excludedEmbedMetadataKeys":[],"excludedLlmMetadataKeys":[],"relationships":{"SOURCE":{"nodeId":"40be1332-299d-46d3-876d-628db117a276","metadata":{"page_number":59,"total_pages":232,"file_name":"NexPoint_Storage_V_DST_a2ffe4a7-0107-4021-8d82-86dec779f2e0.pdf","private":"true"},"hash":"2HtTZiAwsjQBYlfBdEJTDHVA+le+CTWa1NCFYwDrJUY="},"PREVIOUS":{"nodeId":"55b7e46c-91c7-4980-b83e-c814a20204be","metadata":{"page_number":59,"total_pages":232,"file_name":"NexPoint_Storage_V_DST_a2ffe4a7-0107-4021-8d82-86dec779f2e0.pdf","private":"true"},"hash":"B9x4VkWIvFLPTDo/rllrsyF2UaJGoBlXrYHklgY8rUQ="},"NEXT":{"nodeId":"62d50ec3-c5a0-4513-9245-a751e518aac3","metadata":{},"hash":"i8+W6LhRczXRPHNKeIeek3uBxAdxgnO0xn6GNhpSKvY="}},"text":"Thus,

the private placement memorandum for\nthat program (if the property is encumbered by a loan), and total equity raised by the program (or to be raised in the\ncase of ongoing offerings).The table also

set forth in the private placement memorandum for that program).The following terms as used in the table below shall have the meanings set forth in this paragraph.A “cash-\non-cash return” is calculated by dividing the amounts distributed to investors over the indicated period by such\ninvestors’ capital invested in the program, less any proceeds returned in a refinance.All cash-on-cash returns set forth\nherein represent distributions to investors solely from property operations and not from other sources, except as\notherwise described in the notes.With respect to properties subject to a master lease, the cash-on-cash return takes\ninto account additional rents, but not supplemental rents, consistent with the original projections for such program.Supplemental rents have been excluded from this calculation because they are not paid until after the end of the\ncalendar year.The “Acquisition Price” represents the price paid by the program for the property or properties, plus\nall estimated costs and expenses related to the acquisition, all estimated costs and expenses related to the offering and\nany initial contribution to the reserve account, if applicable.","textTemplate":"","metadataSeparator":"\n","type":"TEXT","hash":"6AfXw0AlRfox7kLhFXh7fjAjK5D+C/4iEyM+kx9QW9c="},"207390ea-a3b6-4788-bb1f-e565891a289b":{"id_":"207390ea-a3b6-4788-bb1f-e565891a289b","metadata":{"page_number":84,"total_pages":232,"file_name":"NexPoint_Storage_V_DST_a2ffe4a7-0107-4021-8d82-86dec779f2e0.pdf","private":"true"},"excludedEmbedMetadataKeys":[],"excludedLlmMetadataKeys":[],"relationships":{"SOURCE":{"nodeId":"93d4b1c4-404c-4529-9b3f-db09b33b25db","metadata":{"page_number":84,"total_pages":232,"file_name":"NexPoint_Storage_V_DST_a2ffe4a7-0107-4021-8d82-86dec779f2e0.pdf","private":"true"},"hash":"r1ZHU5si+ZGQFNN/2wY4hCDtj5IxFHrhuY5y6Z7ABoU="},"NEXT":{"nodeId":"0c27b6ee-d2f4-4bb9-9a08-94ed588cfb4c","metadata":{},"hash":"tp+wsUpNTLgU078gUpeQqVfrlmrHhuYRfQ9A/HoBF2k="}},"text":"69\nProgram

Counsel’s opinion is based upon existing cases and rulings, and in particular, the analysis in Revenue\nRuling 2004-86, 2004-2 C.B.191.Revenue Ruling 2004-86 sets forth the limited circumstances under which a DST\nmay be classified as an “investment trust” for federal income tax purposes rather than as a business entity taxable as\na corporation or partnership.Revenue Ruling 2004-86 concludes, that because beneficial owners of interests in an\n“investment trust” are “grantors” that are treated as directly owning an undivided fractional interest in the trust assets\nattributable to that interest for federal income tax purposes, the exchange of real property by such beneficial owners\nfor an interest in an “investment trust” that holds only real property through a qualified intermediary is treated as an\nexchange of real property for an interest in real property, and not the exchange of real property for a certificate of trust\nor beneficial interest under Code Section 1031.Tax Counsel’s opinion that the Beneficial Owners should be treated as grantors of the Parent Trust and\nOperating Trusts means that a Beneficial Owner is required to take into account, in computing its federal income tax\nliability, its proportionate share of all items of income, gain, loss, deduction, and credit attributable to the Parent Trust\nand the Operating Trusts.In addition, all property owned by the Parent Trust and the Operating Trusts will be deemed\nfor federal income tax purposes to be owned by the grantors of the Parent Trust in proportion to their Interests in the\nParent Trust.A Beneficial Owner should be treated as a grantor of the Parent Trust and Operating Trusts because the\nBeneficial Owner conveyed cash to the Parent Trust in exchange for an Interest.In

Parent Trust and Operating Trusts should each be\nclassified as an “investment trust” treated as a “trust” for federal income tax purposes and, further, that the Beneficial\nOwners should be treated as “grantors” of the Parent Trust and Operating Trusts.Accordingly, the Parent Trust and\nOperating Trusts should not be subject to federal income tax and each Beneficial Owner should be subject to federal\nincome taxation as if the Beneficial Owner owned directly the portion of the Properties proportionate to the Interest\nowned by the Beneficial Owner and as if the Beneficial Owner paid directly its share of expenses paid by the Parent\nTrust and Operating Trusts.The following discussion assumes that each of the Parent Trust and the Operating Trusts is, and the Interests\nrepresent interests in, an “investment trust” that is treated as a trust for federal income tax purposes.Code Section 467 Rent Allocation.Under the Master Leases, if one or more Property’s cash flow is\ninsufficient to support all operating expenses and Base Rent and other payments, the applicable Master Tenant may\ndefer on a month-to-month basis a portion of its Additional Rent or Supplemental Rent payments.Although the issue\nis not completely settled under existing law, under Code Section 467 of the Code, if the applicable Master Tenant\nwere to defer payment of rent, the Beneficial Owners may still be required to report and pay tax on rent in accordance\nwith the schedule set forth on Exhibit A to the applicable Master Lease.As a result, Beneficial Owners may be\nrequired to recognize rental income even though all of the rent may not be currently paid and, in such circumstances,\nmay have to use funds from other sources to pay tax on such income.In addition, Beneficial Owners may have to\nrecognize imputed interest income on such deferred amounts.Depreciation and Cost

and Cost Recovery.Current federal income tax law allows an owner of improved real property\nto take depreciation deductions based on the entire cost of the depreciable improvements, even if such improvements\nwere to be financed in part with borrowed funds.If, however, the purchase price of an Interest is in excess of its fair\nmarket value, a Purchaser will not be entitled to take depreciation deductions to the extent deductions are derived from\nsuch excess.The Code provides separate cost recovery rules for certain “qualified improvement property.”Qualified\nimprovement property is any improvement to an interior portion of a building that is non-residential real property if\nthe improvement is placed in service after the date the building itself was first placed in service.Prior to the TCJA,\nthere were three categories of qualified improvement property (qualified leasehold improvement property, qualified\nrestaurant property, and qualified retail improvement property) and each was subject to a 15-year recovery period.The TCJA eliminated these categories with the intention of establishing a single 15-year recovery period for all\nqualified improvement property.However, the Code as it was actually amended does not include this intended 15-\nyear recovery period.As such, the Code as written subjects qualified improvement property to the 39-year recovery\nperiod that generally applies to real property.Due to the limitation on expenditures for improvements imposed upon\nthe Trusts, the Signatory Trustees do not anticipate that the Trusts will make significant expenditures for “qualified\nimprovement property.”Under the TCJA, up to $1,000,000 of certain improvements made to non-residential real property after the\nproperty is first placed in service may be expensed and currently deducted for tax purposes during the taxable years\nbeginning after December 31, 2017 and ending before January 1, 2026 (subject to certain limitations).Due to the\nlimitations on expenditures for improvements imposed on the Trusts, the Managers do not anticipate that the Trusts\nwill incur a significant amount of any such expenses.The amount of depreciation

or business of performing services as an employee or\nany electing real property trade or business (or any electing farming business or certain regulated utility businesses).A real property trade or business is any real property development, redevelopment, construction, reconstruction,\nacquisition, conversion, rental, operation, management, leasing or brokerage trade or business.To take advantage of the “electing real property trade or business” exception, a taxpayer must make an\nirrevocable election to be excluded from Code Section 163(j) and forego or limit certain other tax benefits.An electing\nreal property trade or business is required to use the ADS for any nonresidential real property (which would then be\ndepreciable by the straight-line method over 40 years), residential rental property (which would then be depreciable\nby the straight-line method over 30 years), or for certain improvements to an interior portion of a building which is\nnonresidential real

are constantly under review by persons involved in the\nlegislative process, the IRS, and the Treasury, resulting in revisions of resolutions and revised interpretations of\nestablished concepts as

manage and control the property, as well as any liability with respect\nto the property, the IRS concluded that the Illinois land trust could not rise to the level of\nan “entity” separate from the beneficial owner for federal income tax purposes.In contrast, the IRS concluded in Revenue Ruling 2004-869 that the DST described therein\nwas an entity that should be recognized as separate from its owners for federal income tax\npurposes.The IRS did so by looking to the powers, limitations, and benefits that Delaware\nlaw accords to a DST and its beneficial owners.Under Delaware law, creditors of a\nbeneficial owner in a DST may not assert claims directly against the property held by a\nDST; they can seek payment only from the beneficial owner herself.The property of a\nDST is subject to attachment and execution with respect to liabilities of the DST as if the\nDST were a corporation.A DST may sue or be sued.The beneficial owners of a DST are\nentitled to the same limitation on personal liability stemming from actions of a DST that is\nextended to stockholders of a corporation organized under Delaware law.A DST may\nmerge or consolidate with or into one or more statutory entities or other business entities.A DST can be formed for investment purposes.These powers and privileges afforded to a\nDST and the beneficial owners thereof, as well as the purpose of a DST, led the IRS to\nconclude that a DST is an entity separate from its owners for federal income tax purposes.10\nBased on the authorities discussed above, the Parent Trust and the Operating Trusts

the\ndepositor controlled the voting rights of the shares and the trust instrument governed and\nrestricted the disposal of the shares.Under the terms of the trust instrument, property\ndeposited into

another opinion released on the same day as Chase National Bank, the Second Circuit\nreached a different result.In Commissioner v.North American Bond Trust,20 the court\nrecognized that, although the trust arrangement was similar to the trust in Chase National\nBank, the trust instrument was slightly different because it provided the depositor with the\npower “in effect to change the investment of certificate holders at his discretion.”21 In\nmaking up new units, the depositor was not confined to the same bonds he had selected for\nthe previous units.Additionally, the bonds of all units constituted a single pool in which\neach certificate holder shared according to his proportion of all the certificates issued.As\na result, the money from new investors could be used to purchase new bond issues that\nwould in turn reduce the existing certificate holders’ interests in the old bond issues.The\ndepositor thus could take advantage of market variations in a manner that could improve\nthe investment of the original investors through dilution of the original investment.Based\non these facts, the court held that the depositor “had power, though a limited power, to vary\nthe existing investments of all certificate holders at will…”22 and, accordingly, that the trust\nwas treated as taxable as an association rather than as a fixed investment trust.Revenue Ruling

rental real property, Blackacre, which was the sole\ncollateral for the loan from the Bank.Immediately thereafter, John “net” leased the\nproperty to Mary for a term of 10 years.23 Under the terms of

investments limited the trustee to a fixed return similar to that earned on a bank\naccount and eliminated any opportunity to profit from market fluctuations, the power to\ninvest in such assets was not a power to vary the trust’s investments.Similarly, the IRS classified the trust arrangement described in Revenue Ruling 79-77,27\nwhich was formed to hold real property, as a “trust” for federal income tax purposes.The\nbeneficiaries were required to approve all agreements entered into by the trustee and they\nwere personally liable for the debts of the trust.The beneficiaries directed the trustee to\nenter into a 20-year lease that required the tenant to pay all taxes, assessments, fees, or\nother charges imposed on the property by federal, state, or local authorities.In addition,\nthe

entity into an investment trust prior to the admission of purchasers.We believe\nthat, like the material provisions discussed above, these provisions are consistent with,\nrather than contrary to, the analysis in Revenue Ruling 2004-86 for the reasons set forth\nbelow.First, the Company (or its affiliate’s) ongoing role as the Parent Manager should not be\nviewed as inconsistent with the analysis in Revenue Ruling 2004-86 or the case law\nbecause the Parent Manager’s powers are limited to those permitted to be exercised by a\ntrustee of a fixed investment trust.Second, the Parent Trust’s acceptance of multiple contributions over time should not be\nviewed as raising additional capital (which is prohibited under Revenue Ruling 2004-86)\nbecause the capital of the Parent Trust is not increasing.Both the terms and the amount of\nthe Offering were established at the time the Parent Trust Agreement was made.Additionally, the proceeds of the additional closings must be distributed to the\nContributor.44 Further, the fact that 100% of the Interests may be sold in multiple closings\nrather than in a single closing is driven by practical considerations and does not provide a\nbasis for distinguishing a trust from a partnership.In addition, because the terms of the\nOffering are fixed, the additional contributions do not enable the Parent Trust to benefit\nfrom market fluctuations over time.Third, prior to conversion, the Parent Trust is not recognized as an entity separate from the\nCompany (or its affiliate) for federal income tax purposes.45 Accordingly, the conversion\nfeature of the Parent Trust from a disregarded entity to a fixed investment trust should be\nviewed on its own as a mere formation of the Parent Trust as a fixed investment trust in a\nmanner that is not inconsistent with the analysis under Revenue Ruling 2004-86.Because none of these provisions permit the Parent Manager to vary the investments of the\nParent Trust in a manner

the Operating Trusts’ potential acceptance of multiple contributions over time\nshould not be viewed as raising additional capital (which is prohibited under Revenue\nRuling 2004-86) because the capital of the Operating Trusts is not increasing.The fact that\n100% of the Interests may be sold in multiple closings rather than in a single closing is\ndriven by practical considerations and does not provide a basis for distinguishing a trust\nfrom a partnership.In addition, because the structure of the Offering is fixed, if there were\nany additional contributions, such additional contributions would not enable the Operating\nTrusts to benefit from market fluctuations over time.Finally, although the Operating Trust\nAgreements are flexible in this regard, it is the intention of the parties that the Offering will\nonly syndicate Interests in the Parent Trust to Purchasers (i.e., not Interests in the Operating\nTrusts).56\nThird, prior to conversion, the Operating Trusts are not recognized as entities separate from\nthe Company (or its affiliate) for federal income tax purposes.57 Accordingly, the\nconversion feature of the Operating Trusts from disregarded entities to

we believe that the alteration rights provided to the Master Tenants under the Master\nLeases should not violate the intent and purpose of Revenue Ruling 2004-86 or the\nunderlying cases and rulings governing whether the Managers possess an impermissible\nright to vary the investments of the Parent Trust or the Operating Trusts.2.Although the Parent Trust and the Operating Trusts have\nmore than one class of ownership interests, the Trusts nonetheless should be described\nas investment trusts classified as “trusts” because they were formed to facilitate direct\ninvestment in the Properties and the repurchase of the Class 2 Beneficial Interests is\nincidental to that purpose.The often cited principle that the economic substance of a transaction, and not its mere\nform, governs the tax treatment of a given transaction is a well-established doctrine of\nfederal tax law.60 Treasury Regulations describing an investment trust applies this\nprinciple by providing that a trust arrangement that otherwise would be treated as an\ninvestment trust absent multiple classes of ownership interests nonetheless will be so\ntreated if the multiple classes of ownership interests are incidental to the investment\npurpose of the trust.61 The Treasury Regulations illustrate by example the type of different\nownership rights that would be merely incidental to a trust’s investment purpose.The first example illustrates a circumstance whereby the existence of two classes of\nownership interests in a trust is incidental to the trust’s purpose of facilitating direct\ninvestment in a portfolio of residential mortgages.62 The originator of the mortgage\nportfolio transferred the mortgages to a bank under a trust agreement, retained the class D\nbeneficial ownership interest in the trust and sold to investors the class C beneficial\nownership interests in the trust.The two classes (class C and class D) are identical except\nthat, in the event of a default on the underlying mortgages, the payment rights of the class\nD interests are subordinate to the rights of the class C certificate holders.The example\nobserves that the interests of the beneficial holders in the aggregate, however, is\nsubstantially equivalent to an undivided ownership interest in the mortgage pool, coupled\nwith a limited recourse guarantee running from the originator to the class C beneficial\nholders.","textTemplate":"","metadataSeparator":"\n","type":"TEXT","hash":"g2bFZMfCbM2Wi44goMEu0/11zr9YIg1YaGXsPJeSrW0="},"6c142b00-588b-42db-868d-03c9ceb5b2b8":{"id_":"6c142b00-588b-42db-868d-03c9ceb5b2b8","metadata":{"page_number":190,"total_pages":232,"file_name":"NexPoint_Storage_V_DST_a2ffe4a7-0107-4021-8d82-86dec779f2e0.pdf","private":"true"},"excludedEmbedMetadataKeys":[],"excludedLlmMetadataKeys":[],"relationships":{"SOURCE":{"nodeId":"bf2cb5cc-4a72-4005-a231-0f9f94a8669d","metadata":{"page_number":190,"total_pages":232,"file_name":"NexPoint_Storage_V_DST_a2ffe4a7-0107-4021-8d82-86dec779f2e0.pdf","private":"true"},"hash":"yRz3u0NOsks+M0BGxs3OLlWi6AEXfT8PB8mbFhU6LH4="},"PREVIOUS":{"nodeId":"db4d0098-58f6-49e8-9a6c-a3e21eca6686","metadata":{"page_number":190,"total_pages":232,"file_name":"NexPoint_Storage_V_DST_a2ffe4a7-0107-4021-8d82-86dec779f2e0.pdf","private":"true"},"hash":"g2bFZMfCbM2Wi44goMEu0/11zr9YIg1YaGXsPJeSrW0="}},"text":"Thus,

another example illustrates a circumstance where multiple classes of ownership\ninterests in a trust merely facilitate direct investment in the assets held by the trust.63\nPurchasers purchased trust certificates evidencing the right to receive a particular payment\nwith respect to a specific bond that is included in a bond portfolio held by the trust.Because\nthe purchase of stripped interests in bonds and coupons are treated as separate bonds for\nfederal income tax purposes, the example states that the multiple classes simply provide\neach certificate holder with a direct interest in what would be treated as a separate bond.Because the certificate holders acquired an interest in the trust’s assets that was similar to\nwhat the certificate holder could acquire by direct investment, the multiple classes of\nownership interest will not prevent the trust arrangement from being treated as a trust rather\nthan a business entity for federal income tax purposes.It is possible that the IRS may assert that the existence and redemption of the Contributor’s\nand the Parent Trust’s Class 2 Beneficial Interests give rise to multiple classes of ownership\ninterests even though the rights of Parent Trust’s Class 2 Beneficial Owner otherwise will\nbe identical to the rights of the Parent Trust’s Class 1 Beneficial Owners immediately upon\na Purchaser investing in the Parent Trust.64

risks of ownership (i.e., downside) and will enjoy the\nprofits of the property (i.e., upside).Revenue Procedure 2001-2895 sets forth advance ruling guidelines for “true lease” status.The Parent Trust has not sought, and does not expect to request, a ruling from the IRS\nunder Revenue Procedure 2001-28.These ruling guidelines provide certain criteria that\nthe IRS will require to be satisfied in order to issue a private letter ruling that a lease is a\ntrue lease for federal income tax purposes.In the event of an examination by the IRS, the\nIRS and, ultimately, the courts of applicable jurisdiction, would consider these ruling\nguidelines, together with existing cases and other rulings, in determining whether the\nMaster Leases qualify as true leases for federal income tax purposes.However, we do not\nbelieve that strict compliance with Revenue Procedure 2001-28 is required to conclude that\nthe Master Leases should be characterized as true leases for federal income tax purposes.Rather, we believe that satisfying most of the material ruling guidelines should be sufficient\nfor this purpose.Accordingly, the following discussion reviews the factors considered\nrelevant by the IRS under Revenue Procedure 2001-28 guidelines, as well as the relevant\ncase law.96\nMinimum Unconditional At-Risk Investment.Under the Revenue Procedure, the lessor must make a minimum unconditional “at risk”\ninvestment in the property (the “Minimum Investment”) when the lease begins, must\nmaintain such Minimum Investment throughout the entire lease term, and such Minimum\nInvestment must remain at the end of the lease term.The Minimum Investment must be\nan equity investment (the “Equity Investment”) that includes only consideration paid, and\n93 Id.at 838;

the property, or guarantee any indebtedness created in connection with the\nacquisition of the property by the lessor.111 A guarantee by any member of the Lessee\nGroup of the lessee’s obligation to pay rent, properly maintain the property, or pay\ninsurance premiums or other similar conventional obligations of a net lease does not\nconstitute a guarantee of the indebtedness of the lessor.112 There are no guarantees under\nthe Master Leases or other Transaction Documents that violate this requirement.Profit Requirement.The lessor must expect to receive a profit from the transaction apart from the value of or\nbenefits obtained from the tax deductions, allowances, credits, and other tax attributes\narising from such transaction.Under the Revenue Procedure 2001-28 guidelines, this\nrequirement is met if: (a) the aggregate amount required to be paid by the lessee to or for\nthe lessor over the lease term plus the value of the residual investment exceed an amount\nequal to the sum of the aggregate disbursements required to be paid by or for the lessor in\nconnection with the ownership of the property and the lessor’s Equity Investment in the\nproperty, including any direct costs to finance the Equity Investment; and (b) the aggregate\namount required to be paid to or for the lessor over the lease term exceeds by a reasonable\namount the aggregate disbursements required to be paid by or for the lessor in connection\n110 In addition, in its private ruling practice under Revenue Procedure 75-21 (the predecessor to Revenue\nProcedure 2001-28, which included a similar requirement), the IRS has generally concluded that the\nmaking of an improvement by a tenant not permitted under this guideline will not affect the true lease\nanalysis.See

can be received by a lessor as rent without the lessor becoming a partner in the\nenterprise.A share of net receipts, as opposed to gross receipts, is stronger evidence that\na partnership

whereas the Operating Trusts receive rent from the\nMaster Tenants.Under the Treasury Regulations, the sharing of gross rents, without more,\nis very unlikely to create a partnership arrangement.124

entering the transaction, and that the transaction has no\neconomic substance because no reasonable possibility of a profit exists.”142 This test\ntherefore analyzes both the objective and subjective aspects of a transaction, i.e., the\neconomic substance and the subjective business motivation behind the transaction,\nrespectively.143 These objective and subjective aspects are not “discrete prongs of a ‘rigid\ntwo-step analysis,’” but rather are related factors in the analysis of whether a transaction\nhas sufficient substance, apart from its tax consequences, to be respected.144\nWith respect to determining profit potential, the courts have not traditionally established a\nthreshold amount of profit to determine whether a transaction should be respected for\nfederal income tax purposes.The Tax Court has in some cases required more than a de\nminimis amount of profit, especially where transactions involving financial instruments are\nconcerned.145 Other courts, however, have been

Transaction Doctrine.Applicable Rules.Under the sham transaction doctrine, a transaction may be disregarded if it constitutes a\nfactual sham or an economic sham.A factual sham is a purported transaction that is not\nexecuted as a factual matter.162 In contrast, an economic sham is a transaction that has\noccurred, but is devoid of economic substance.163 In general, the economic sham doctrine\nwill not be applied if the taxpayer can prove that there is either a business purpose for, or\neconomic substance to, the given transaction.164\nThe application of the sham transaction doctrine is extremely fact specific, and has led\ncourts to render somewhat inconsistent rulings in this area.For example, the Third Circuit\nin ACM Partnership v.Commissioner disregarded the capital loss that arose from a\ncomplex, multi-step partnership transaction.165 The court ultimately concluded that the\nsteps involved in the transaction lacked a non-tax economic effect and did not possess a\nsignificant non-tax business purpose.166 The Third Circuit nevertheless recognized that “it\nis well established that where a transaction objectively affects the taxpayer’s net economic\nposition, legal relations, or non-tax business interests, [a transaction] would not be\ndisregarded merely because it was motivated by tax considerations.”167 The transaction at\nissue in Boca Investerings Partnership v.U.S.168 was similar to the ACM transaction, but\nthe District Court for the District of Columbia respected the partnership transactions at\nissue in that case.The Boca court concluded that the partnership had been formed as a\nvalid investment partnership.It had the potential to make a profit or loss from its activities,\nand the partners were not sheltered from economic risk or guaranteed a specific return on\ntheir respective partnership investments.162 Brown v.Comm’r, 85 T.C.968, 1000 (1985), aff’d sub nom, Sochin v.Commissioner, 843 F.2d 351 (9th\nCir.1988); Brion

the\ntransaction had objective economic substance because tax was Compaq’s principal, but not\nsole, purpose in entering into the transaction.170 As a result, Compaq could credit the\nforeign taxes

sale was consummated, the corporation’s tax\nattorney advised that the sale would result in the imposition of a large income tax on the\ncorporation.To avoid this tax liability, and upon advice of its tax attorney, the corporation\nchanged the transaction by having the corporation declare a liquidating dividend to its\nshareholders, and having the shareholders enter into a written agreement with

step transaction doctrine should not be applicable to the Parent Trust’s and the\nOperating Trusts’ contractual arrangements.In this case, the Beneficial Owners constitute\na separate, diverse, and

(i.e., collective ownership of the Properties by an\nunrelated group of Beneficial Owners) can only be achieved if the intermediate steps of (i)\nthe Operating Trusts acquiring the Properties, and (ii) offering the Interests for sale to the\nBeneficial Owners is first undertaken.Thus, the step transaction doctrine should not be\napplied to recharacterize the transaction steps utilized to implement the proposed\ncontractual arrangement.Moreover, even if the IRS were to collapse the transaction steps\ntogether, the resulting transaction (a direct purchase of the Properties by the Beneficial\nOwners) should not significantly change the resulting federal income tax effect of the\nParent Trust’s and the Operating Trusts’ contractual arrangements.**************\nA number of issues

other than as set\nforth in the Memorandum of which this Exhibit C forms a part that would necessarily cause the financial information contained in the\nFinancial Forecast to fail to be indicative of future operating results.However, if the assumptions with respect to one or more Properties\ndo not prove correct, such Properties will have difficulty in achieving its anticipated results.Some of the other underlying assumptions\nmay not materialize, and unanticipated events and circumstances may occur.Therefore, the actual results achieved during the period\ncovered are likely to vary from the

demand for cash flowing assets and availability and total volume of money supply.While the Sponsor maintains a view on these future drivers of capitalization rates, forecast outcomes vary.It is our\nbelief that the range of outcomes presented herein represent a reasonable range of potential exit outcomes for investors given all known variables as of the date of this Memorandum.","textTemplate":"","metadataSeparator":"\n","type":"TEXT","hash":"Ms0TPAYWzlFgtd1wJwvTxfVdlKy/ux+rgVOB4XJ4U50="},"e9573cbd-da91-4e92-8cd2-a3eae1fbe76f":{"id_":"e9573cbd-da91-4e92-8cd2-a3eae1fbe76f","metadata":{"page_number":228,"total_pages":232,"file_name":"NexPoint_Storage_V_DST_a2ffe4a7-0107-4021-8d82-86dec779f2e0.pdf","private":"true"},"excludedEmbedMetadataKeys":[],"excludedLlmMetadataKeys":[],"relationships":{"SOURCE":{"nodeId":"f4d26ce7-91e1-48f3-9035-877bc9539918","metadata":{"page_number":228,"total_pages":232,"file_name":"NexPoint_Storage_V_DST_a2ffe4a7-0107-4021-8d82-86dec779f2e0.pdf","private":"true"},"hash":"830PtIjSitIao6O+YBVmReN32yP8HRZKkrThQ2sYfrQ="},"NEXT":{"nodeId":"1284d1dc-4590-482a-b8f7-1d11ad64bbc0","metadata":{},"hash":"XVyuGEgIvL33wMRuQVH/NXrqIeoA9ox7aLTtqqK9br4="}},"text":"Storage
